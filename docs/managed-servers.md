# Managed servers

A tunnel has two ends, and every value that matters has to agree on both: the
token, the port, the transport, the MTU, the forged source address. Setting one
up used to mean configuring Iran, then opening a second terminal, logging into
the far server as root, and doing it again by hand. Half the support traffic
this project generates is one end disagreeing with the other because a value was
mistyped on the second pass.

A **managed server** removes the second pass. You give the panel the server's
address and its root login, and the panel writes both ends.

## What it is

The panel logs into the far server over **SSH** — the same way you would — and
runs one command there.

That is a plain statement of what you are agreeing to, and it is worth reading
twice: **the panel holds root on that machine.** It can do anything root can do
there, and anyone who takes the panel takes the server with it.

This replaced an earlier design that avoided exactly that. In it, the far server
ran an agent that dialled the panel and accepted a fixed list of operations, so
the panel held an authorisation rather than an identity. It was the better shape
on paper and it was worse in practice, for reasons that were not about security
at all:

- Every server needed **its own inbound port on the panel**, opened in the
  firewall, remembered, and not colliding with anything.
- Setting one up meant pasting a command on that machine — so you left the
  panel, found a terminal for a server you might only have a password for, and
  came back.
- The agent was a **third service to install, keep running and debug**, and when
  it was not running the panel simply said the server was offline.

Each of those was a way for a server to be listed in the panel and unreachable
anyway, and between them they accounted for most of what went wrong with the
feature. SSH is already running on that machine, already authenticated, and
already how it is administered. Nothing to install, no port to open, nothing to
paste.

If you are not comfortable giving the panel root on a server, do not add it —
build its tunnels from the CLI on each machine instead. The panel still shows
their cards and their logs from this side.

## Which way the connection goes

The panel dials out. The far server opens nothing for bk, and the panel
opens nothing for the fleet — there is no listener on either side beyond the
sshd that was already there.

That also means a server behind NAT with no inbound route cannot be managed,
which the old design allowed. In exchange, a panel with no public address can
manage servers perfectly well, which it could not.

## Setting one up

**Servers → Add a server.** Four things, which is everything SSH needs:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Address** | the server's IP or hostname |
| **SSH port** | usually 22 |
| **Username** | usually root |
| **Password** | that user's password |

Plus a **name** for it — what the panel and its tunnels will call it, fixed once
it is added.

The panel reaches the server while you wait, so a wrong password is a message
now rather than a server that sits in the fleet doing nothing. A server that
does not answer is not saved: an entry that has never worked is not a server, it
is a typo.

If bk is not installed there, the panel installs it — that is the ordinary
case for a server you have just bought, not a failure. It fetches the same
installer you would run by hand, from the same place, so the archive and its
checksum still arrive from one origin.

### The host key

The first time a server answers, the panel records the SHA-256 of the host key
it presented, and every connection after that must match — trust on first use,
the same bargain as typing `yes` at ssh's own prompt.

If it ever changes, the panel refuses to connect and says so. Either that server
was rebuilt, or something is answering in its place. Remove it from the fleet
and add it again if the change was expected.

Changing a server's address clears the key with it: a different machine is
entitled to a different one. For the same reason a new address needs the
password typed again. Keeping the stored one would hand it, on the first
connection, to whatever answers at the new address — so the panel refuses the
change without it. Adding a server, changing its login and removing it need the
panel password or an `admin` token; a `write` token can refresh, upgrade and
pin, but not touch a login (see [access control](access-control.md)).

### Where the password is kept

In `/etc/bk/nodes.json`, on the panel's own server, `0600` and owned by
root — the same file and the same permissions as every other secret bk
holds. It is never sent to the browser.

## Building a tunnel on both ends

**Tunnels → Add tunnel.** Pick the managed server that holds the other end, fill
the form once, and the panel writes this end here and mirrors it there.

There is no second form and nothing to carry anywhere. Without a managed server
the screen says so and points at the fleet, because with nothing to write the
far end on it could only build half a tunnel.

The far server's address is not asked for. It reported what it is when the panel
first reached it, and a value it reports is better than one typed: it cannot be
mistyped and it does not go stale.

### If the far end does not take

The reply says `partial`, names the server, and says what failed there. This end
is real and running; the other is not. Fix what it says and edit the tunnel —
the edit pushes the far end again.

### Editing later

An edit here is an edit on both. What the far end answered for itself — its own
connection tuning — is read back and carried across, so a rebuild does not drop
settings you gave when the tunnel was paired.

### Editing from the CLI menu

The menu edits this machine only. It says so when the tunnel has a far end,
because an edit that silently changes one side is how the two come to disagree.

### Starting, stopping and restarting

All three reach both ends. If the far server cannot be reached, this end still
does what you asked and the reply says the other did not.

### Deleting

Deleting removes this end. The far end keeps running: a delete on this machine
is not consent to one on another, and there is deliberately no operation that
removes a tunnel on a managed server.

## Checking the fleet is running what you asked for

Every fleet operation is a one-way instruction: the panel tells a server to
create a tunnel, the server says it has, and that used to be the end of it.
Nothing remembered the instruction, so nothing could notice it had stopped
being true.

**Servers → Check the fleet** asks every managed server what it is running and
compares it with what this panel asked for. It reports:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `missing` | the panel created it and the server does not have it — removed there, or an apply that reported success and did not last |
| `stopped` | it is there and not running, and nothing here asked for it to be stopped |
| `running` | it was stopped from here and is running there |
| `changed` | the port or the role no longer match what was written — the two ends no longer meet, and both look fine from their own side |
| `unexpected` | the server is running a tunnel this panel did not create: made on the machine itself, or left over from a panel restored from a backup |

**It changes nothing.** It is a report, not a repair, and that is deliberate
rather than unfinished: something that re-applied on its own would be a loop
that can fight you in the middle of a change, and what it would be fighting over
is the tunnel you are reaching the machine through. See
[design decisions](design-decisions.md).

A server that could not be reached is listed apart from one that has drifted.
A machine that is down has not changed — it is simply not answering.

It is a button rather than something that runs on a timer because it asks every
server in turn over SSH, which is minutes on a large fleet.

## Logs from both ends

A tunnel is one thing in two places and its log is not. The tunnel's **Logs**
screen has a switch — this server, or the one holding the other end — so a
client that cannot dial, a certificate it could not read or a port already held
over there says so without logging into that machine.

## Keeping them up to date

Each card has **Upgrade**, and when a release lands the fleet page says which
servers are behind it with one button for all of them. It is the same installer:
it replaces the binary and restarts what was running.

## Removing a server

**Remove** on its card. The tunnels built there keep running on both machines —
what goes is this panel's ability to reach one end of them, and its record that
the two were a pair.

## On the managed server

Nothing. There is no bk service, no config and no state that belongs to
being managed: the panel logs in, runs one command, and logs out. Removing the
server from the fleet leaves nothing behind to clean up.

The one command is `bk node exec -`, which reads one request from stdin
and performs a single operation from a fixed list — create or update a tunnel,
start, stop, restart, report, read a log — and refuses anything else. It is not
meant to be typed. The request comes on stdin rather than as an argument
because it can carry a tunnel's token, and a command line is readable by every
user of the machine; a server too old to read stdin is sent it as an argument,
as before, until it is upgraded.

## What to think about before turning it on

- The panel holds a root login for every server in the fleet. Its own password
  and its own exposure now matter as much as theirs.
- Adding a server and upgrading one run `install.sh` from GitHub on that server,
  which checks the release against its published SHA-256 — but not the release
  signature that **Update** on this machine requires. A checksum fetched from
  the same place as the archive proves the download is whole, not who made it.
  Where that matters, upgrade the far server from its own menu.
- A server behind NAT with no inbound route cannot be managed.
- The far server's sshd must accept password authentication for the user you
  give.

## خلاصهٔ فارسی

سرور مدیریت‌شده یعنی ماشینی که یک‌بار به پنل معرفی‌اش می‌کنی و بعد هر دو سر یک
تونل را از یک صفحه می‌سازی — بدون SSH زدن و بدون نگه‌داشتن لاگینی برای آن ماشین.

**چطور کار می‌کند:** پنل با **SSH** به سرور دور وصل می‌شود، دقیقاً همان‌طور که
خودت وصل می‌شوی، و یک دستور آنجا اجرا می‌کند. این جمله را دوبار بخوان: **پنل روی
آن ماشین root دارد.** هر کاری که root می‌تواند آنجا بکند، پنل هم می‌تواند، و هر
کس پنل را بگیرد آن سرور را هم گرفته. اگر با این راحت نیستی، اضافه‌اش نکن —
تونل‌هایش را از CLI روی خود ماشین بساز؛ پنل باز هم کارت و لاگش را از این طرف
نشان می‌دهد.

**چرا این شکل، نه agent:** طرح قبلی روی سرور دور یک agent داشت که به پنل زنگ
می‌زد و فقط فهرست ثابتی از عملیات را قبول می‌کرد — روی کاغذ امن‌تر، در عمل بدتر:
هر سرور یک **پورت ورودی جدا روی پنل** می‌خواست که باید در فایروال باز و یادت
می‌ماند؛ راه‌اندازی یعنی رفتن سراغ ترمینالِ همان ماشین و برگشتن؛ و agent یک
**سرویس سومِ** نصب‌کردنی و دیباگ‌کردنی بود که وقتی بالا نبود پنل فقط می‌گفت
«offline». SSH همین حالا آنجا در حال اجراست، همین حالا احراز هویت دارد و همین
حالا راهِ ادارهٔ آن ماشین است.

**جهت اتصال:** پنل زنگ می‌زند. سرور دور چیزی برای bk باز نمی‌کند و پنل هم
چیزی برای ناوگان باز نمی‌کند. یعنی سروری که پشت NAT است و راه ورودی ندارد
مدیریت نمی‌شود — که طرح قبلی اجازه می‌داد — ولی در عوض پنلی که هیچ آدرس عمومی
ندارد می‌تواند سرورها را مدیریت کند، که قبلاً نمی‌توانست.

**کلید میزبان:** بار اول، پنل SHA-256 کلید میزبان را ثبت می‌کند و از آن به بعد
هر اتصال باید با همان بخواند — همان «trust on first use» که وقتی به ssh `yes`
می‌گویی. اگر عوض شود پنل وصل نمی‌شود و می‌گوید؛ یا سرور از نو ساخته شده یا چیز
دیگری جایش جواب می‌دهد. عوض‌کردن آدرس سرور کلید را هم پاک می‌کند.

**رمز کجاست:** در `/etc/bk/nodes.json` روی سرور خود پنل، با مجوز `0600` و
مالکیت root — همان فایل و همان مجوزی که هر راز دیگر bk دارد. هیچ‌وقت به
مرورگر فرستاده نمی‌شود.

**ساختن تونل روی هر دو سر:** وقتی جفت را از پنل می‌سازی، **هر دو** سر نوشته
می‌شود، پس تنظیم‌های جفتی (توکن، ترنسپورت، پورت) نمی‌توانند با هم اختلاف داشته
باشند — که رایج‌ترین دلیل «وصل است ولی چیزی رد نمی‌شود» است.

**بررسی اینکه ناوگان همانی را اجرا می‌کند که خواسته‌ای:** هر عملیات روی ناوگان یک
دستور یک‌طرفه بود — پنل می‌گفت تونل بساز، سرور می‌گفت ساختم، و تمام. هیچ‌جا ثبت
نمی‌شد، پس هیچ‌وقت هم معلوم نمی‌شد که دیگر درست نیست. با
`Servers → Check the fleet` پنل از هر سرور می‌پرسد چه چیزی اجرا می‌کند و با چیزی
که خودش خواسته بود مقایسه می‌کند: `missing` (ساخته شده و آنجا نیست)، `stopped`
(هست و اجرا نمی‌شود، بدون اینکه کسی از اینجا گفته باشد بایستد)، `running` (از
اینجا متوقف شده و آنجا در حال اجراست)، `changed` (پورت یا نقش با چیزی که نوشته
شده نمی‌خواند — یعنی دو سر دیگر همدیگر را پیدا نمی‌کنند، و هر دو از دید خودشان
سالم‌اند) و `unexpected` (تونلی که این پنل نساخته).

**هیچ چیزی را عوض نمی‌کند** — گزارش است نه تعمیر، و این عمدی است: چیزی که خودش
دوباره اعمال کند، حلقه‌ای است که می‌تواند وسط کار با تو بجنگد، و چیزی که سرش دعوا
می‌شود همان تونلی است که از طریقش به ماشین رسیده‌ای. سروری که در دسترس نبوده جدا
از سروری که drift کرده فهرست می‌شود؛ ماشینی که خاموش است تغییری نکرده، فقط جواب
نمی‌دهد.
