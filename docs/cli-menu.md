# The CLI menu — complete reference

Every option in every menu, including the advanced ones. Open the menu as root:

```bash
sudo bk
```

Each option carries a short gray description in the terminal; this page is the
long form. For *how to set a tunnel up*, use the
[tutorials](../tutorial/README.md) instead — this page is what each thing **is**.

## Main menu

| # | Option | What it does |
|---|--------|--------------|
| 0 | **Connection Test** | Runs every reverse transport and direct carrier between this server and another for real — started on the Iran server, joined on the kharej with the link it prints — and shows which ones carry traffic steadily, which drop, and which never come up, with round trip and speed. Nothing is installed; the test tunnels are gone when it ends. |
| 1 | **Setup Iran** | Create the **Iran-side** tunnel that exposes ports. Asks the direction first — reverse or direct. |
| 2 | **Setup Kharej** | Create the **kharej-side** tunnel that holds the real service. Asks the direction first. |
| 3 | **Manage** | Everything about existing tunnels, plus the diagnostics. [↓](#3-manage) |
| 4 | **Backup & Restore** | The whole configuration as one `.tar.gz`. [↓](#4-backup--restore) |
| 5 | **Web Panel** | The monitoring dashboard — port, login, certificate. [↓](#5-web-panel) |
| 6 | **Optimize** | Applies system-wide kernel/network tuning: BBR + fq, socket-buffer ceilings, file-descriptor limits. Answer yes and it prints each change. A reboot is recommended for the file-limit changes. It also keeps the kernel's own ephemeral port range (`32768 60999`) rather than widening it, and reserves the ports your tunnels listen on — see [what it does to ports](#optimize-and-your-service-ports) |
| 7 | **Telegram Bot** | Reports, alerts and control from Iran. [↓](#7-telegram-bot) |
| 8 | **Update** | Verified update with automatic rollback. [↓](#8-update) |
| 9 | **Uninstall** | Removes everything bk installed. |
| 10 | **Exit** | |

A red banner above the menu appears when a newer release exists. It reads a
cached answer, so a slow or blocked GitHub never delays the menu.

## 1 & 2 — the setup wizards

The questions, in the order they are asked. `[Y/n]` marks the default.

### Setup Iran

Both setup entries ask **Reverse or Direct** before anything else. The table
below is the reverse flow; the direct flow is much shorter and is listed after
it.

Set up the **Iran server first**; its summary shows a setup link the kharej
server pastes.

| Prompt | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Select Transport Family** / **Select … Transport** | TCP / UDP / WebSocket, then the variant. [Transports](transports.md) |
| **Iran IP Or Domain (What Kharej Dials)** | this server's detected public IP is the default; the setup link carries it to kharej |
| **Backup Addresses For The Kharej** | optional — this server's other IPs, a domain, a CDN edge (`host` or `host:port`). The link carries them and the kharej fails over to them on its own |
| **Tunnel Port** | what the client dials. Refused if already in use for that protocol. `85.10.11.51:443` pins it to one address — see [Port mappings](port-mappings.md#binding-to-one-local-address) |
| **Listen On IPv6 As Well** `[y/N]` | only for a bare port; binds `::`, which accepts IPv4 too on a dual-stack host |
| **Forwarded Ports** | `443`, `443=127.0.0.1:2096`, `443=a:1\|b:2`, `10000-10009`, `85.11.12.13:443=127.0.0.1:2096`, comma separated. [Every form](port-mappings.md) |
| **Tunnel Name** | names the service (`bk-<name>`) and the config file |
| **Security Token** | generated here — press Enter. The setup link carries it |
| **Carry UDP As Well As TCP On Those Ports** `[y/N]` | off by default. [Forwarded UDP](forwarded-udp.md) |
| **TLS Certificate** | wss/wssmux only — Self-Signed, Let's Encrypt, or Existing Files |
| **Simple Token Auth** `[y/N]` | wss/wssmux only — for a TLS-terminating proxy in front |
| **TCP Flag Pattern** / interface override | pck only. [TCP + PCK](tcp-pck.md) |
| **Send Real Client IP (PROXY Protocol)** `[y/N]` | where the transport can carry it. [Real client IP](real-client-ip.md) |
| **How Should The Tunnel Be Tuned?** | [Presets](performance-presets.md) |
| **Fine-Tune The Advanced Settings** `[y/N]` | [↓ the advanced settings](#the-advanced-settings-fine-tune) |
| **Restart This Tunnel On Both Servers Every N Hours (0 = Off)** | off by default — the tunnel recovers from a dropped path on its own. When set, both servers restart it at the same moment (a systemd timer in UTC; the link carries the schedule) |

Then one short summary — *Reverse TCP*, where it listens, the address kharej
dials, the forwarded ports and where each lands on kharej, the certificate,
tuning, config file — with two ways to build the kharej under it, and **Create
This Tunnel**:

- **Setup Link** — the `bk://…` line, for a kharej that already runs
  bk: paste it under Setup Kharej → Setup Link (or run
  `bk link apply '<link>'` there).
- **Install bk And Set Up This Tunnel** — one command, run as root on a
  kharej without bk: it installs bk, builds the tunnel from the
  link, starts it and says whether it connected. Nothing is asked.

Both are shown again under **Manage tunnels → the tunnel → Setup Link**. A
link can be pasted as it arrived — inside a message, in quotes, broken over two
lines. Applying the same link twice on one kharej is refused: a second tunnel
with the same token would take the connection from the first.

### Setup Iran / Setup Kharej → Direct

A direct tunnel is always a full IP tunnel wrapped in bk's own GRE, so
there is nothing to choose about the shape or the framing — only how it travels.
[Direct tunnel](l3-direct-tunnel.md)

Set up the **Iran server first**; its summary shows a setup link the kharej
server pastes. The Iran questions, in order:

| Prompt | Notes |
|---|---|
| **How Should The Packets Travel?** | **xDi**, **PCK**, **UDP**, **Quic**, **IP Spoofing**, **SNI Spoofing**, in that order; both ends choose the same one |
| **Kharej IP Or Domain** | Iran dials out, so it needs no inbound port of its own |
| **Tunnel Port** `[9000]` | what kharej binds and Iran reaches |
| **Forwarded Ports (Blank For TUN)** | optional. Blank is a plain private network that routes what it is given. A port something here already listens on (the panel's `7777`) is refused |
| **Tunnel Name** | names the service and the config file |
| **Security Token** | generated here — press Enter. The setup link carries it to kharej |
| **Carry UDP As Well As TCP On Those Ports** `[y/N]` | only when ports were given |
| **Turn On Error Correction (FEC)** `[y/N]` | for a route that drops packets; about a third more traffic |
| **Spread The Tunnel Over Several Sockets** `[y/N]` / **How Many Sockets (2-8)** | UDP only — for a provider that limits each connection. One port per socket from the tunnel port up, open on kharej; the summary shows the range |
| **How Should The Tunnel Be Tuned?** | Turbo / Balance / Aggressive — the queue and the socket buffers. [Presets](performance-presets.md) |
| **Fine-Tune The Advanced Settings** `[y/N]` | tunnel addresses (a free `10.10.N.0/30` by default), starting MTU, interface name, GRE key, segment cap, caps |
| **Restart This Tunnel On Both Servers Every N Hours (0 = Off)** | as for reverse above |

Then one short summary — interface, where it dials, forwarded ports, tuning,
config file — with the **Setup Link** (`bk://…`) and the one-line
**Install bk And Set Up This Tunnel** under it, as for reverse, and
**Create This Tunnel**. The link is shown again under **Manage tunnels → the
tunnel → Setup Link**.

On kharej: the same carrier, then **How Do You Want To Set Up This Side?** —
**Setup Link** (paste the line; asks only for a name) or **Manual** (tunnel
port, both tunnel addresses as Iran printed them, a name, and the Iran
server's token, which kharej never generates). A spoof kharej is also asked
for the Iran server's real IP.

**IP Spoofing** and **SNI Spoofing** keep the classic wizard: no setup link,
both ends set up by hand, the **kharej** side suggests the token and the Iran
side pastes it (left blank, Iran generates one to carry over), and both are
asked the tunnel addresses. Their answers — which forged source a route
carries, which domain it lets through — are worked out on each machine.

The MTU is not a question worth agonising over: the tunnel measures the path
once it is up and corrects the interface itself.

### Setup Kharej

After the transport (the same one as Iran), **How Do You Want To Set Up This
Side?** — **Setup Link** (paste the line; only the name is asked) or
**Manual**:

| Prompt | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Iran IP Or Domain** | resolved and checked: a CDN in front of a raw transport, or an AAAA record that would send the tunnel over IPv6, is warned about |
| **Tunnel Port** | the same one Iran binds |
| **Tunnel Name** | |
| **Security Token (From The Iran Server)** | no default — paste Iran's |
| **Edge IP (Optional, For A CDN)** | WebSocket family only — connect to a CDN edge rather than the server address |
| **Simple Token Auth**, **TCP Flag Pattern** | as above, where the transport calls for them |
| **Optional Connection Settings** `[y/N]` | opens: **Proxy URL** (not on datagram transports), **Interface** / **Source Address** (multi-homed hosts only), **Backup Addresses**, then **Automatic Failover To The Healthiest Address** or **Load Balance Over All Addresses**. [Failover](failover-load-balancing.md) |
| **How Should The Tunnel Be Tuned?** | the same one as Iran |
| **Fine-Tune The Advanced Settings** `[y/N]` | |

---

## 3 — Manage

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Manage Tunnels** | Per-tunnel actions. [↓](#manage--manage-tunnels) |
| **Status** | A live table of every tunnel: role, transport, state, uptime, traffic. |
| **Health Check** | Tests the server, the panel and every tunnel, and prints a **fix** under each problem it finds. Start here when something is wrong. [More](health-check.md) |
| **Link Test** | Measures the real route (latency, jitter, loss) and recommends a transport with matching timers. On a lossy link it names the exact FEC ratio and offers to apply it. [More](choosing-a-transport.md) |
| **Exit Health** | Scores and ranks every server address of a tunnel by `rtt + 2·jitter + 20·loss%`, and offers to pin the healthiest as the primary. The manual companion to health failover. |
| **IP Spoofing Tester** | Two-node test that finds which forged source IPs actually cross the path. [More](ip-spoofing.md#the-ip-spoofing-tester) |
| **Tunnel Metrics** | Traffic and connections per transport and, on KCP, retransmits, loss and packets repaired by FEC. Totals survive restarts. [More](tunnel-metrics.md) |
| **Restart ALL** | Restarts every tunnel at once and reports how many failed. |
| **Auto Refresh** | Restart every tunnel every N hours. `0` disables it. |
| **Built-in Proxy** | Makes this node its own SOCKS5/HTTP backend, so nothing separate has to be installed behind the tunnel. [↓](#manage--built-in-proxy) |
| **File Locations** | Where every config, service, log and backup lives. [More](server-layout.md) |

### Manage → Manage Tunnels

Pick a tunnel, then:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Edit** | Everything about the tunnel's configuration. [↓](#manage--manage-tunnels--edit) |
| **Start / Stop / Restart** | The systemd service for that tunnel. |
| **Live Log** | Streams the journal. Ctrl+C returns. |
| **Delete** | Removes the tunnel permanently, after a confirm. |

### Manage → Manage Tunnels → Edit

The screen opens with a summary of the tunnel's current settings, then offers
only the entries that apply to its role and transport.

**On a server (Iran) tunnel:**

| Entry | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Change tunnel port** | The control port clients dial. Checked against what is already bound *on that protocol*. **Change the client to match**, or it cannot reconnect. |
| **Change forwarded ports** | Enter the **full new list**, not an addition. |
| **Change transport** | Switches the carrier, keeping name, token and ports. **Switch the other side too.** A TLS transport generates a self-signed certificate automatically if needed. |
| **Change performance preset** | Rewrites **every** tuning value — buffers, pool size, mux windows, and on KCP the ARQ and FEC settings. Use the same preset on both ends. |
| **Real client IP** | PROXY protocol v2. **The service must be set to accept it first** or every connection breaks. [More](real-client-ip.md) |
| **Limits** | Max simultaneous connections and Mbit/s for this tunnel as a whole; `0` = unlimited. Warns below 10 connections — one browser opens more. [More](limits.md) |
| **Forward UDP** | Carry UDP on the exposed ports too. Off by default. [More](forwarded-udp.md) |
| **TCP MSS clamp** | Non-datagram transports only. Leave at 0 unless Health Check reports a smaller path MTU — it prints the number. **Same value on both ends.** [More](mss-clamp.md) |
| **TCP packet flags** | `pck` only. What this end's flag field says; each end decides its own, so they need not match. [More](tcp-pck.md) |
| **IP Spoofing** | `spoof` only. The forged source, the profile, and everything else. [More](ip-spoofing.md) |
| **Certificate** | wss/wssmux only. Switch between self-signed and Let's Encrypt. [More](../tutorial/websocket-tls.md) |

**On a client (kharej) tunnel:**

| Entry | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Change server tunnel port** | Must match the server side. |
| **Change server address** | The Iran IP or domain. |
| **Change transport** | As above — switch both ends. |
| **Backup server addresses** | The full new list; empty clears them. The client walks the list until one answers. [More](failover-load-balancing.md) |
| **Change performance preset** | As above. |
| **Load balancing** | Off: backups are spares, used one at a time. On: connections are spread over all of them at once. **Every address must reach the same server.** |
| **TCP MSS clamp**, **TCP packet flags**, **IP Spoofing** | As on the server, where the transport applies. |

Every edit is written and applied in one go, and **reverted automatically if the
tunnel does not come back up**.

### Manage → Built-in Proxy

This node serves its own SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy on a loopback port, so the tunnel
exit *is* the proxy — no xray, no panel, nothing separate to keep running. Then
forward a tunnel port to `127.0.0.1:<that port>`.

| Prompt | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Proxy type** | SOCKS5 (works for most apps, carries UDP too) or HTTP (for clients that only take an HTTP proxy) |
| **Port to listen on** | loopback only; you choose, nothing is assumed |
| **Require a username/password** | set one unless the forwarded port on the Iran server is closed to everyone but you. The proxy binds loopback here, but the tunnel forwards it to a public port there, and the tunnel token authenticates the two servers — not the people using the port. Without auth it is an open proxy for anyone who reaches that port. |

Whatever the answer, the proxy refuses to reach this server itself: loopback,
unspecified, link-local (the cloud metadata address among them) and multicast
destinations are refused after the name is resolved, for SOCKS5 CONNECT, SOCKS5
UDP and the HTTP proxy. Other private addresses stay reachable — reaching a LAN
behind the kharej is a common reason to run it.

## 4 — Backup & Restore

A backup bundles **every tunnel, the web-panel password, Telegram settings, TLS
certificates and the auto-refresh schedule** into one portable `.tar.gz` under
`/root/bk/backups`.

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Create a backup file** | Choose the directory; the file is timestamped. **Keep it private — it contains tokens and the panel password.** |
| **Restore from a backup file** | Pick one from the folder or enter a path. **Overwrites** existing tunnels and settings, after a confirm. The panel is restarted so a restored password takes effect. |

[More](backup-restore.md)

---

## 5 — Web Panel

A monitoring-only dashboard, recommended on the **Iran** server. The header shows
the URL, the login code and the state.

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Change panel port** | default 7777 |
| **Regenerate login code** | a new random 8-digit code |
| **Set a custom password** | replaces the login code with your own |
| **Certificate** | serve the panel over HTTPS |
| **Restart panel** | also starts it when stopped |
| **Stop panel** | disables the web UI. Monitoring, alerts and the watchdog keep running — they live in a separate service |

[More](web-panel.md)

---

## 7 — Telegram Bot

The header shows the report interval, relay status, alert summary and admin
count.

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Configure / Update bot** | token, admin id, and how the bot reaches Telegram (automatic through a tunnel peer, always a named tunnel, or direct) |
| **Alerts** | warn when CPU, memory or disk crosses a threshold, a tunnel goes down or comes back, or a new release appears — each with a recovery message. [More](alerts.md) |
| **Admins** | who else may use the bot, and who may only look |
| **Diagnose relay** | names the exact hop that is broken when messages do not arrive |
| **Send a test report now** | verifies the whole chain |
| **Disable reports** | stops the scheduled reports |

[More](telegram-bot.md)

---

## 8 — Update

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Check for updates** | Downloads the release, **verifies it against the published SHA-256**, installs it, and rolls back automatically if a tunnel does not come back up. Anything that cannot be verified is refused rather than installed |
| **Restore points** | Go back to a previous version |
| **Release channel** | stable only, or also test pre-releases |

[More](updates.md)

---

## The advanced settings (Fine Tune)

Asked at the end of both setup wizards behind
**"Fine-Tune The Advanced Settings"** (default: no), and available
per-tunnel in the web panel's **Fine Tune** drawer.

**You do not need any of these.** The preset has already filled in every value,
and each prompt starts from the preset's answer — anything you leave alone keeps
it. Editing them marks the tunnel **Custom**, so a later preset change will not
silently overwrite your answers.

### Asked on both roles

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **TCP_NODELAY** | Sends small writes immediately instead of waiting to coalesce them. On = lower latency, slightly more packets. |
| **Keepalive period (seconds)** | How often the connection is probed for liveness. |
| **Heartbeat interval (seconds, 0 to disable)** | The tunnel's own liveness message. Too short wastes bandwidth on a slow link; too long delays noticing a dead peer. Link Test derives a value from your real round trip. |
| **Log level** | `info` (default), `debug`, `warn`, `error`. |
| **Write logs as JSON** | For a log collector or a script. The human-readable text format stays the default. |

### Server only

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Channel size** | The queue between the accept loop and the forwarders. Bigger absorbs bursts at the cost of memory. |

> **Forward UDP** used to be asked here. It is now asked in the main server flow,
> right after the exposed ports — and changed afterwards from
> **Edit → Forward UDP**.

### Client only

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Connection pool size** | How many connections are kept ready to carry a forward, so a new one need not be dialled first. |
| **Aggressive pool** | Refills the pool harder — faster under bursty load, more idle connections. |

### Non-datagram transports

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **TCP MSS clamp (bytes, 0 = automatic)** | The largest TCP payload the tunnel puts in one packet. **Keep it at 0** unless Health Check reports the path cannot carry full-sized packets; it prints the number, and both ends need the same one. Deliberately not part of any preset. [More](mss-clamp.md) |

### Mux transports (tcpmux, wsmux, wssmux)

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Mux connections/sessions** | How many real connections carry the multiplexed streams. |
| **Mux version** | smux protocol version, 1 or 2. |
| **Mux frame size** | The largest chunk written per frame. |
| **Mux receive buffer** | Per-session receive window — the ceiling on in-flight data for the session. |
| **Mux stream buffer** | Per-stream window, which is what stops one heavy stream consuming the session. |

### KCP transports (kcp, xdi, spoof, pck)

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **KCP MTU (bytes)** | Keep it **below the path MTU**. |
| **KCP interval (ms)** | The tick. Lower reacts faster and costs CPU; 10 ms on the gaming presets. |
| **KCP send window / receive window (packets)** | Packets in flight. With congestion control off the window **is** the queue — bigger is not better for ping. |
| **FEC data shards** | Packets per parity group. `0` disables error correction. |
| **FEC parity shards** | Losses repairable per group. |

The shard counts must match on both ends. [More](../tutorial/udp-kcp-fec.md)

### Plain `tcp` only

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Zero-copy forwarding (experimental)** | Lets the kernel move bytes directly between the two sockets. The fastest path here and the least proven — try it on a spare tunnel first. Linux only, plain `tcp` only, and only when the tunnel has no bandwidth limit; anything else quietly keeps the buffered path. Purely local, so the two ends need not agree. |

---

## Optimize and your service ports

Optimize tunes the kernel for a machine carrying a lot of connections. One of
the things it deliberately does **not** do is widen the ephemeral port range,
and it is worth knowing why.

The ephemeral range is the set of ports the kernel hands out as the *source*
port of outgoing connections. On Linux it is `32768 60999` by default, and
Optimize leaves it there. Widening it — which this used to do, to `1024 65535` —
means every service port on the machine is inside the range something can be
given, and **a port held as the source of an outgoing connection cannot be bound
by the service that owns it**.

That failure is unusually hard to read, because the port is taken by a
connection rather than a listener:

```
$ ss -tlnp | grep 62050        # what everyone runs
                               # → nothing at all

$ ss -tnp | grep 62050         # what is actually there
ESTAB 127.0.0.1:62050 127.0.0.1:46877 users:(("some-process",pid=...))
```

So the service fails to start with `address already in use`, and the usual
command to find the culprit shows an empty result. It is intermittent by nature
— it depends on which source port the kernel happened to pick — which is why it
can appear weeks after everything was set up, and clear when whatever held the
port is restarted.

Optimize also writes the ports your tunnels listen on into
`net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports`, so a tunnel port that *does* fall inside the
range can never be taken this way either.

**If a service on your server cannot bind its port**, check the range first:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range      # expect: 32768   60999
grep -r ip_local_port_range /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/
ss -tnp | grep <the port>                       # -tnp, not -tlnp
```

A range wider than the default, from any source, puts every service above
`32768` at risk. Reserve those ports in `ip_local_reserved_ports` or put the
range back.
