# topgsmir distribution

## v1.10.0 — dependency preparation and SSH reverse (2026-10-09)

- Automatically install and verify missing selected cores on both test servers; report installation/setup failures explicitly instead of silently skipping selected methods.
- Detect existing usable SSH keys and prepare verified key authentication interactively when needed, without storing passwords in configurations or links.
- Add SSH reverse to setup and real connection tests, with checked host keys, loopback remote forwarding and automatic reconnection.
- Synchronize peer preparation and final diagnostics; test forwarding denial, interrupted SSH recovery, and all 18 additional TCP/UDP variants using real cores.
- Preserve original tunnel engines and connection-test probes. Update both servers: the additional test plan is now version 2.

## v1.9.0 — optional additional tunnels (2026-10-09)

- Add a separate menu 11 for GRE IPv4, L2TPv3 IP/UDP, AmneziaWG, verified SSH pooling, RGT reverse TCP/UDP and direct VXLAN, and Paqet KCP/raw TCP.
- Connect every Alghadir layer into a complete GRE -> IPsec ESP -> KCP/FEC -> udp2raw fake TCP -> obfs4 path, with fresh authenticated session keys and private network namespaces.
- Add an independent option 0 connection test for these methods, reusing the original real echo, 60-second soak, recovery, RTT and byte-identical bulk probes, with additional payload-size tests.
- Keep all original tunnel engines, setup wizards and dependency versions unchanged. Additional named services and configurations have independent lifecycle and scoped cleanup.
- Verify pinned upstream core downloads; document sources, IPv4/architecture requirements, SSH authentication and separate management in docs/additional-tunnels.md.
- Add mandatory real Linux namespace tests with actual upstream cores and OpenSSH, authentication failure tests, race checks and resource-cleanup checks.

## v1.8.6.1 — publication validation (2026-10-09)

- Fix the Docker CI checkout trust boundary so the PCK Connection Test can build on GitHub-hosted runners.
- Upgrade Go to 1.26.9 and golang.org/x/net to 0.60.0 to address reachable issues found by the security gate; refresh official installer checksums.
- Require the complete Go version including its security patch in source installs and retain the selected toolchain path; test old, exact, newer and prerelease versions.

## v1.8.6 — bk distribution (2026-10-09)

- Publish bk maintained by topgsmir, based on BackPack by Amin Mohammadi (AminMGMT): https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack.
- Align command, services, installation/configuration paths, panel, share links and release assets with bk.
- Fix PCK loopback routing, receive filtering across interfaces, and replies from the contacted local address; add real-socket regression tests and privileged CI validation.
- Preserve engine wire identifiers for compatibility. Retain AGPL-3.0 and original attribution.
- Install and uninstall from topgsmir/bk; independently signed releases and standalone repository visibility.

## v1.8.5.1

- Configure installation, source links, support and updates for topgsmir/BackPack.
- Use the distribution's own module path and release signing key.
- Add a standalone uninstall.sh with confirmation and a dry-run mode.
- Preserve upstream attribution and document private downloads and publication prerequisites.
- Publish both installation and removal scripts with signed release assets.

# Changelog

All notable changes to Backpack are documented here.

## v1.8.5 — 2026-09-30

### Added

- **A traffic limit per tunnel.** Set on the Iran end from the pencil in the
  card's bottom band, which now reads *used / limit* with a line that turns
  amber at 70% and red at 90% (no limit is the default, shown as ∞). The
  Traffic limit dialog has presets from 50 GB to 10 TB, any amount in GB or
  TB, and quick adds. The engine enforces it: the running total, in and out
  together, is checked four times a second and the tunnel goes offline the
  moment it reaches the limit — the card says *Limit reached* — and stays
  offline, service still up, until the limit is raised; then it comes back on
  its own within two seconds. The count is the tunnel's own total, which
  restarts, reloads and updates carry over and a backup restores, so nothing
  resets it but deleting the tunnel. `/api/tunnel/quota`; the limit is
  `<name>.quota.json` beside the config.
- **`backpack proxy enable <socks5|http> <port> [--user U --pass P]`**, `proxy
  disable` and `proxy status` — the menu's Built-in Proxy without the menu,
  and the line Manage → Built-in Proxy hands over for the kharej.
- **Applying a setup link again updates the tunnel it made.** After an edit on
  the Iran end, `sudo backpack link apply '…'` on the kharej rewrites its end
  of that tunnel in place — same name, the new transport and port — instead of
  refusing because the tunnel exists. `link apply` also reads better: a boxed
  report with the result, and "waiting for the Iran server" printed while it
  waits, not after.

- **Web panel: the dock is now Overview · Connection test · Tunnels · Terminal
  · Manage.** *Connection test* runs the Iran side of the menu's Connection
  Test from the browser — start it, copy the one `sudo backpack link apply
  '…'` line (or the install-and-test line for a kharej without Backpack), and
  watch every transport's row fill live, ending in the best-settings card.
  *Terminal* is a root shell on the server (xterm.js, vendored under
  `panel/js/vendor`, MIT): browser sessions only — never an API token —
  same-origin WebSocket, at most four at once, and every one opened is written
  to the audit record and the alert feed. The shell survives moving between
  sections. *Manage* carries Auto Refresh (with a 24-hour dial of when the
  restarts land), the Built-in Proxy (enable, disable, and a test that speaks
  the SOCKS5/HTTP handshake with the configured credentials) and File
  Locations (grouped, filterable, with size, item count and age). *Servers* is
  out of the dock for now; its route still answers.
- **Web panel: the rest of the menu's setup, backup, update and panel screens.**
  *Setup link* (tunnel card → ⋯ → Setup link…, and at the end of Add tunnel
  when only this end is built) shows the link with the kharej's
  `sudo backpack link apply '…'` line and the install-and-set-up line.
  *Maintenance → Backup* lists the archives kept in the backups folder with
  Back up now, Test (the menu's Test A Restore — changes nothing), Download,
  Restore and Delete, and sets and tries the off-site copy command.
  *Maintenance → Update* installs from an uploaded
  `backpack_linux_<arch>.tar.gz` (+ SHA256SUMS), refusing another
  architecture's archive, and *Restore points* can roll back. *Settings →
  Panel access* moves the address path (random, your own, none), issues a new
  login code and restarts the panel, following it to its new address. The
  fleet key stays in the menu only, on purpose (see menu/backup.go).
- **Web panel: Add tunnel no longer needs a managed server.** It is the CLI
  wizard again — Iran or kharej, then reverse or direct (as two cards, not a
  small switch), then the tunnel, performance, optional and done — and it
  builds this server's end only, ending on the setup link for the other one.
  The token is made here and carried by the link; the reverse Iran side's
  token field had no name, so it was never sent.
- **Connection Test (main menu, option 0): which transports actually hold
  between two servers.** Started on the Iran server, it runs a real engine for
  every reverse transport the wizard offers (tcp, tcpmux, stealth, pck, ws,
  wss, wsmux, wssmux, kcp, quic, udp) and, as root, every direct carrier (udp,
  quic, pck, xdi, sni) on free ports, with the performance preset the operator
  picks, and checks IP spoofing both ways the way Manage → IP Spoofing Tester
  does, with 10.10.10.10 as the forged source. It prints a short link —
  `backpack://t.` and 26 characters: where the Iran side's coordinator is and
  the test's secret. On the kharej, the same menu item or `backpack link apply
  '<link>'` fetches the rest from the coordinator in one packet and builds the
  other end of each tunnel from it, by the path a real tunnel takes. The Iran
  side then pushes traffic through every tunnel, an echo a second for a minute
  and a 1 MB transfer, and both servers show one table, live: each tunnel's
  row fills as its echoes come back (TESTING, echoes sent, a bar), rewritten
  in place. At the end the rows are grouped OK, UNSTABLE and DOWN, each bar
  filled by the echoes that came back, with the tunnels that carried
  everything listed under it with their round trip and speed. Under that, a
  second table gives the settings to build with: the fastest steady transport,
  the preset its speed and round trip call for, the path MTU (measured with
  unfragmentable probes) and the TCP MSS clamp it implies, the MTU the direct
  tunnels measured, keepalive and heartbeat, and FEC — the timers and FEC by
  the same rules as Link Test. Nothing is installed and nothing is left
  behind. Made after a route that cut every flow after a few packets had to be
  diagnosed by hand; over a simulated route like that it reports every
  ordinary transport as failing and names the carriers that got through.

- **A kharej without Backpack is set up with one command.** Under the setup
  link, the Iran wizard (and Manage → Setup Link) now prints a second line:
  `bash <(curl -fsSL …/install.sh) link apply 'backpack://…'`. Run as root on
  the kharej, it installs Backpack, builds the tunnel from the link, starts it,
  and waits to say whether it connected — nothing is asked. On a kharej that
  already runs Backpack the same is `backpack link apply '<link>'`, which also
  takes `--name` and `--host` (for a link that does not carry the Iran
  server's address). Applying the same link twice is refused, since a second
  tunnel with one token takes the connection from the first.
- **The setup link carries backup addresses.** The reverse Iran wizard asks
  for this server's other addresses — another IP, a domain, a CDN edge — and
  a kharej built from the link fails over to them on its own.
- **A tunnel can restart on both servers at once, on a schedule.** Both Iran
  wizards ask *Restart This Tunnel On Both Servers Every N Hours (0 = Off)*;
  off by default. The schedule is a systemd timer in UTC, so an Iran server on
  +03:30 and a kharej on UTC restart together; the link carries it to the
  kharej. (Auto Refresh, from cron in each machine's own timezone, restarts
  the two ends hours apart.)
- **A setup link can be pasted as it arrived** — inside a Telegram message, in
  quotes, or broken over two lines.


### Changed

- **Setup links are half as long.** A new link format (backpack://2.) carries
  exactly the same settings as before — each field as a one-byte number, the
  repeated words as one byte, an IPv4 address in four bytes, the token packed
  as the base-62 number it is, and the default name left out — with a checksum
  so a link cut short in a paste is refused. A reverse tunnel's link went from
  264 characters to 132. Links from older builds (backpack://1.) still work; a
  build older than this one cannot read the new format and says so.

- **IP spoofing and SNI spoofing use the new wizard and the setup link.** Both
  are set up from the Iran server like every other carrier: the Iran side
  answers what both ends share (packet profile, Stealth, the SNI domain) and
  its own forged source, and the link carries the shared answers — and, for
  spoof, the Iran server's real address — to the kharej, which asks only its
  own: the source it forges, its interface, and the Iran server's address when
  a link lacks it. The classic both-ends-by-hand wizard is gone.

- **The menus are shorter.** Every screen of the terminal menu — the main
  menu, Manage, the wizards, Edit, Backup, Web Panel, Telegram, Update and the
  tools — now reads in short Title Case labels, and the paragraphs of
  explanation are one line or gone.

### Security

- **Anyone could redirect a direct tunnel on the default `udp` carrier.** The
  carrier took the source of every datagram it read as the peer — before the
  tunnel had authenticated anything — and sent the whole tunnel there. One
  forged datagram to the listening port moved the tunnel to the sender. A
  single path now hands its peer to the tunnel, which moves it only on an
  authenticated packet. With `paths` above 1 each extra socket still follows
  its own sender; that is documented as the price of multipath.
- **A write-scoped panel token could send a managed server's root password to
  a machine of its choosing.** Changing a server's address kept its password
  and forgot its host key, so the next login trusted whatever answered at the
  new address and gave it the password. A new address now needs the password
  typed again, and adding, re-crediting and removing a server need the admin
  scope.
- **`wss` now proves the server, not only the client.** The server answers the
  upgrade with `X-Backpack-Proof`, a MAC of the TLS session under the tunnel
  token, so something on the path that terminates the TLS can no longer pose
  as the Iran server. An older server that does not answer is still accepted;
  one that has answered once in this run and then stops is refused. Plain
  `tcp`, `tcpmux`, `ws` and `udp` still do not authenticate the server — the
  docs now say so instead of implying they do.
- **With the password known, the second factor could be guessed without
  limit.** The password step reset the failure count, so password, four wrong
  codes, password again never reached the lockout. The count is now reset only
  by a complete sign-in, and a pending sign-in dies after three wrong codes.
- **The built-in SOCKS5/HTTP proxy without auth was an open door into the
  server itself.** It binds loopback, but a tunnel forwards its port to the
  public side, and the tunnel token authenticates servers, not the people using
  the port — so anyone could reach the server's loopback services and the cloud
  metadata address through it. Loopback, unspecified, link-local and multicast
  destinations are now refused after resolution, for CONNECT, UDP ASSOCIATE and
  the HTTP proxy alike.
- **The Update menu ran any release archive it found in the current
  directory, as root,** just to show its version. It now looks only in `/root`
  and the install directory, and skips a directory that is not root's (or this
  user's) or that others can write to.
- **A failed Telegram send put the bot token in the error**, and the panel's
  *Send test message* showed that error to anyone with a write token. Errors
  are redacted now.
- **The bot answered admins in group chats** — the panel password on `/webui`
  and the backup archive included — for every member to read. It answers in
  private chats only and says so elsewhere.
- **Fleet requests, tunnel tokens included, were readable in a managed
  server's process list.** The panel passed each request as an argument to
  `backpack node exec`. It now sends it on stdin (`node exec -`); a server too
  old to read stdin still gets it the old way until it is upgraded.
- **The panel accepted state-changing requests from a sibling subdomain.**
  `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site` is another origin, and the session cookie is sent
  on its POSTs. Those are now refused like cross-site ones.
- **A flood of connections that never proved the token was unbounded.** Every
  ingress now bounds what a stranger may hold, and a host that has proved the
  token is never refused because of a flood: reverse `tcp`/`tcpmux`/stealth
  tunnel ports and the `udp` control port take at most 128 unproven
  connections per host (per /64 for IPv6) and 1024 in all; `udp` control
  claims are judged side by side, so one silent connection no longer holds the
  real client for 15 seconds; a reverse `quic` connection may keep 8 streams
  waiting; `ws`/`wss` tunnel ports time out slow request headers; a direct
  origin bounds its handshakes the same way and no longer keeps a goroutine per
  finished `ws`/`wss` session; the l3 `quic` carrier evicts strangers before
  its peer, `pck` caps and ages its peer table, and the l3 listener remembers
  only authenticated handshakes, so made-up ones cannot push real ones out of
  its replay memory. A refused connection is logged as *too many connections
  that have not proved the token*. See `docs/adr/0004-what-an-unproven-peer-may-hold.md`.
- **A direct tunnel's handshake freshness could be walked backwards** while no
  session was up. A stale stamp is now adopted only once its session is
  confirmed by traffic.

### Fixed

- **Web panel field report, 2026-09-30.**
  - Every tunnel made in the panel came out as Turbo's numbers with no preset
    (the edit dialog then said Custom), whatever preset was picked: Add tunnel
    posted every switch and menu of the Fine Tune drawer as it was drawn, and
    any tuning sent clears the preset. Only what was touched is sent now. An
    untouched direct form also read the reverse form's preset row and sent
    none, which the server took as Turbo.
  - Editing a reverse tunnel's transport — UDP to TCP, reported on v1.8.4 —
    took several tries: choosing the TCP family left the transport on "udp",
    so saving changed nothing. The transport now follows the family. And the
    kharej, still on the old transport, could not reconnect; after a change
    both ends must agree on, the dialog now shows the kharej's one line, which
    brings that end into step (see Added).
  - A direct tunnel whose flow the path stopped passing stayed down until its
    port was changed by hand (reported on v1.8.4). The reopen-from-new-ports
    fix pck and sni got in this version now covers udp, xdi and quic too: after
    90 seconds of unanswered handshakes the dialling end opens a new socket,
    which is a new flow. Spoof is left out — its source is forged, not a port
    this end can move.
  - Settings and Maintenance showed the preview's sample figures (1.7.6, five
    restore points, another server's port) for the seconds it took to ask
    GitHub for the latest release. Dialogs now open on a loader until their
    values are in, and the release check is kept for ten minutes and warmed
    when the panel starts.
  - On a phone, the tunnel Metrics dialog ran off its right edge — its section
    rules had taken the log lines' grid — and the Logs toolbar, the Edit tabs,
    the Settings search and the History figures overflowed. All fit now.
  - Connection test is two panes of one size: the left one is the form, then a
    15-minute dial with the kharej's line under it, then the test's own
    countdown, then *Best for this path*; the right one waits, fills row by row
    as each transport is tried (patched in place, not redrawn), and at the end
    lists only what held or wobbled, with what went down counted underneath.
    "Preset" in the verdict is now "Suggested preset", and the preset the test
    ran on is named beside it.
  - Manage: Auto Refresh is a square card with a 24-hour dial and a live
    countdown to the next restart on the server's own clock and zone; the
    Built-in Proxy beside it can be wired to a reverse tunnel — it adds the
    forward and hands over the kharej's `backpack proxy enable` line; File
    Locations is a search bar that opens.
  - Tunnel cards fill the row — two tunnels take the width between them, three
    to a row at most — and carry the preset as a chip (Reverse · TCP ·
    Aggressive · 443).
  - Add tunnel builds the Iran end only: one first step, *this server is Iran*,
    with Reverse and Direct under it; forwarded ports have a Random button; and
    the presets are cards with their own mark, what each is for and its load,
    over a table of what the chosen one sets on this transport.

- **Web panel field report, 2026-09-29.**
  - Tunnel cards' live chart started from nothing on every sign-in: the rate
    history was fed only by the browser's poll. The panel now samples every
    tunnel's snapshot on its own clock.
  - A tunnel card's "up" figure reset whenever the engine reloaded; it is the
    systemd service's ActiveEnterTimestamp now.
  - The overview's server uptime was the host node's on OpenVZ/Virtuozzo
    guests (gopsutil reads /proc/stat's btime there); it is read from
    /proc/uptime.
  - Logs showed "[blob data]" instead of the engine's lines on systemd ≤ 254
    (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04): the coloured level tag made journalctl refuse the
    line without `--all`. The read now passes `--all` and strips the colour
    codes, and the dialog parses the short-iso line into clock, level and
    message.
  - Settings threw "Cannot read properties of null" on any restore point taken
    with no tunnels, which left the preview's sample points (1.7.4/1.7.5) and
    its "Install 1.7.6" row on screen; the Release row now says what is
    actually available.
  - Panel access → Copy did nothing (it found no input to copy, and plain HTTP
    has no `navigator.clipboard`); every Copy button now falls back to
    `execCommand`.
  - Security's two-factor, token and audit text fell back to 16px browser
    type; the audit record is drawn as rows.
  - Alerts: newest first, with day separators, real insets and no "NaN d ago".
  - Metrics dialog: the legend sat on the edge, and the state chip said
    "Running" for any state.
  - Tabbed dialogs (Edit, Settings, Add) keep one height between tabs.
  - The Link test button is gone from tunnel cards.
- **Editing a direct tunnel in the web panel opened the reverse form and could
  not save.** The Edit dialog filled the reverse form — transport families,
  mux and KCP settings a direct tunnel does not have — and posted its fields
  where the direct edit reads nothing. A direct tunnel now gets its own form:
  forwarded ports, UDP, preset, MTU and Auto MTU, sockets (udp), FEC, Stealth
  (spoof) and limits, saved under the direct edit.

- **The web panel was slow.** Three causes. The tunnel list looked up every
  peer's location on every poll with nothing remembered on failure — on a
  server that cannot reach the geo providers, which an Iran server usually
  cannot, that was three providers at up to six seconds each, every six
  seconds; a failed lookup is now remembered for ten minutes and the list
  never waits for one (the answer arrives on a later poll). Every card also
  probed its far end afresh on each poll, and the list waited for the slowest;
  probes and name lookups are now reused for a few seconds and renewed in the
  background. And the panel's files were served with no ETag and no
  compression, so every visit downloaded all of them again: they now go
  gzipped (721 KB to 225 KB) with an ETag, and a return visit is a 304 per
  file.

- **A reverse pck tunnel stopped carrying anything the first time it was
  pushed hard.** When the local transmit queue filled, the packet socket
  reported "no buffer space available", and KCP — which runs on top of pck —
  takes any send error as the end of its session: it closed it for good and
  dropped the rest of what it was sending. Echoes passed; a 1 MB transfer both
  ways stalled at about two thirds, every time, with nothing in the Iran log.
  A full queue is now a lost packet, as it is on a UDP socket, and KCP resends
  it. Found by the new Connection Test; on the same path the transfer now
  runs at 50–80 Mbps, with Turbo and Aggressive alike.

- **The panel's "carried since this server was set up" went back down after
  every update.** Three separate leaks. A direct (layer-3) tunnel's engine
  counts its own traffic, and those counters replaced the carried-over total
  instead of adding to it, so every update, restart or config edit started a
  direct tunnel from zero. A reload of a reverse tunnel added what the process
  had already counted a second time, and could read the file before the last
  write of the previous run was in. And deleting a tunnel took everything it
  had carried out of the total, while the next tunnel given the same name
  started from the old one's figure. Totals now carry over exactly, and a
  deleted tunnel's traffic moves into a server-wide ledger
  (`/etc/backpack/retired-traffic.json`, kept in backups) that the headline
  figure includes. Traffic already lost before this version cannot be
  recovered.

- **Automatic failover to a backup address brought the control channel up and
  left every user connection failing.** With *Automatic Failover To The
  Healthiest Address* on, the kharej raced its addresses and connected the
  control channel through the backup — but its data connections followed the
  health scorer, which measured only ping. A primary address that answers
  ping with its tunnel port closed or filtered (common on these routes, where
  ICMP gets through) kept the pool pointed at it: the tunnel showed connected
  and carried nothing. The address the race reached now steers the pool, and
  for TCP transports the scorer counts an address as reachable only when the
  tunnel port itself takes a connection.
- **A reverse tunnel on an unsteady path restarted every time the kharej
  re-dialed, cutting every user on it.** Reported from several Iran servers on
  v1.8.4: `restarting server...` over and over, and forwarded ports that kept
  dropping. Any trouble with the control channel — the kharej re-dialing after a
  one-second drop, a failed read, a second claim — rebuilt the whole run: the
  tunnel port and every forwarded port were closed and bound again, and every
  user connection through them ended. Now the tunnel and its ports stay up and
  only the kharej is replaced: its new control channel takes over in place, the
  old one's pool is dropped, and users who connect in between wait for it
  rather than being refused. All seven transports; nothing changes on the wire,
  and older kharej servers are served as before. Two kharej servers set up with
  one token — which takes the tunnel from each other every few seconds — are
  named in the Iran log. See `docs/adr/0005-a-generation-outlives-its-clients.md`.
- **A direct `pck` tunnel died after about a day, and only deleting it and
  making it again brought it back — restarts and Auto Refresh did not.**
  Reported on v1.8.4. The dialling end's source port was derived from the
  token, so every restart sent the same flow — the one the path had stopped
  passing — and only a new tunnel, with a new token, got out. The ports are now
  drawn afresh whenever the carrier opens, and when no handshake over a `pck` or
  `sni` flow is answered for 90 seconds the tunnel reopens the carrier on its
  own, from new ports. Tested live with the flow dropped on the path: v1.8.4
  never came back; this build is back within three minutes. The startup log
  now names the source port, interface, next hop and RST guard, as the reverse
  transport's already did; firewall rules left by an earlier run are found by
  the tunnel's tag and removed.
- **Stopping the web panel did not last.** Web Panel → Stop panel stopped it,
  and the next `sudo backpack` started it again. The stop is now recorded and
  kept until Restart panel; a panel stopped under v1.8.4 is recognised as
  stopped, and a restored backup keeps its owner's choice.
- **A reverse kharej made from a setup link could not be created**, while the
  same tunnel typed in by hand worked. The link under Manage → Setup Link did
  not carry the Iran server's address, and Set up from a link then refused with
  "the server address is required" without asking for it. The link now carries
  this server's public address, and a link without one asks for it; the Iran
  wizard also says when it has none to put in the link.
- **There was no way to change the kharej's address in Edit.** A direct tunnel
  whose kharej moved had to be deleted and made again. Edit now has *Kharej
  address* on the Iran side of direct and layer-3 tunnels — an IP or domain
  keeps the port, IP:port changes both, and a spoof carrier's recorded peer
  moves with it — and *Iran server's real IP* on a spoof kharej. The change is
  written to the tunnel's file and the tunnel restarts.
- **Adding a server to the fleet, and upgrading one, installed nothing and
  reported success.** The installer was piped into a shell whose stdin was then
  replaced by `/dev/null`, so the shell ran an empty script and exited 0. The
  installer is now downloaded whole, refused if empty, then run, and a failure
  fails the step. An upgrade also restarts the tunnels, the monitor and the
  panel on that server, so they run the new build rather than only the file on
  disk being new.
- **An update started from the panel or the Telegram bot stopped before it
  restarted the tunnels.** It restarted the panel's own service (or the bot's)
  first, which killed the update midway: the tunnels kept running the old
  binary and the health check and rollback never ran. The tunnels are now
  restarted and checked first, and the panel and monitor last.
- **Saving a config that parsed but failed a check stopped the tunnel.** The
  reload watcher kept a tunnel running through a file that did not parse, but a
  file that parsed and then failed one of the checks run at startup took the
  running tunnel down. The reload now logs why and keeps the running tunnel.
- **An unreadable state file was emptied by the next save.** The fleet
  registry, the panel's config and the bot's settings were read with the error
  ignored, so a damaged file came back empty and the next change wrote that
  emptiness over it. A file that does not parse is now moved aside to
  `<file>.unreadable-<time>` and the journal says so; a file with one field of
  the wrong type keeps the rest, and a copy is kept.
- **`max_connections` shrank with every restart of a reverse tunnel.** A
  connection queued when the tunnel restarted kept its slot for ever, so after
  enough restarts the cap refused everyone. Queued connections are now closed
  and their slots given back when a generation ends.
- **A reverse `udp` tunnel's restart raced its own connections**, replacing a
  lock that the previous generation was still holding.
- **A kharej whose transport ended without a restart — a config reload, a
  fallback chain moving on — left its `kcp`/`quic` sessions and control
  connection open for ever.** Over KCP nothing tells those sockets the peer is
  gone. They are closed with the generation now.
- **A kharej that reconnected just as the Iran end restarted could sit
  "connected" for 20 seconds carrying nothing.** Its claim was accepted by the
  ending generation and then abandoned; it is now refused, and the client
  redials at once.
- **Changing the panel password from the panel always failed.** The panel sent
  it as JSON to a handler that reads a form, so the password arrived empty and
  was refused as too short. It is sent as a form now, and the handler also
  reads JSON, for a panel page cached from before.
- **The l3 `udp` carrier never used its batched and GSO send paths.** The same
  wrapper as the redirection above hid them, so every packet was its own
  system call. They run now: measured live, about 24 datagrams per `sendmsg`.
- **Plain `ws` carried less than half of what `wsmux` did** on the same link:
  every message was read into a fresh buffer and every 64 KiB write split into
  4–16 frames. It now copies through a pooled buffer and writes in 64 KiB
  frames (2.8 → 7 Gbit/s on loopback).
- **Every KCP dial ran 100,000 rounds of PBKDF2**, once per pooled connection.
  The key is derived once per token now.
- **On a tunnel with PROXY protocol and a bandwidth cap, every forwarded UDP
  flow was closed** with an error about the address type.
- **Each junk datagram to a reverse `udp` tunnel port wrote an ERROR line.**
  They are logged at debug now.
- **The file-descriptor warning named the limit it failed to set** rather than
  the one in force.
- **A kharej could not dial a bracketed IPv6 target** such as
  `[2001:db8::1]:443` ("invalid port format").

## v1.8.4 — 2026-09-26

### Changed

- **A direct tunnel is set up from the Iran server, and the kharej server
  pastes one line.** The Iran wizard asks short questions, in order: **Kharej
  IP Or Domain**, **Tunnel Port**, **Forwarded Ports (Blank For TUN)**,
  **Tunnel Name**, **Security Token** — generated on the Iran side, press
  Enter — UDP, **Error Correction (FEC)**, the preset and fine-tuning; the
  tunnel addresses are picked for it. The paragraphs of explanation between
  the questions are gone. The summary before **Create This Tunnel** is one
  short block — *Direct PCK*, interface, where it dials, forwarded ports,
  tuning, config file — with the **Setup Link** (`backpack://…`) under it. On
  the kharej server, after the carrier: **Setup Link** (paste the line; only a
  name is asked) or **Manual**. Each kharej behind one Iran server gets its own
  link. By hand, the kharej side no longer invents a token: it has to be the
  Iran server's.
- **The reverse wizard works the same way.** Iran asks, in order: **Iran IP Or
  Domain** (the detected public IP is the default), **Tunnel Port**,
  **Forwarded Ports**, **Tunnel Name**, **Security Token** (generated — press
  Enter), UDP, then the transport's own questions — **TLS Certificate** and
  **Simple Token Auth** for WSS, **TCP Flag Pattern** for PCK, **Send Real
  Client IP (PROXY Protocol)** where it can be carried — the preset and
  fine-tuning. One short summary (*Reverse TCP*, where it listens, what kharej
  dials, where each forwarded port lands on kharej) shows the **Setup Link**
  before **Create This Tunnel**. On kharej, after the transport: **Setup Link**
  (paste; only the name is asked) or **Manual**, whose token prompt no longer
  offers the meaningless default `backpack`. The link now also carries simple
  auth, the smux version and, for KCP, the exact error-correction pair, so a
  kharej built from it cannot disagree with Iran on them. The `udp` transport,
  whose forwarded ports are UDP anyway, is no longer asked about UDP. Tested
  through the menus on all eleven reverse transports.
- **The direct carriers are listed as xDi, PCK, UDP, Quic, IP Spoofing, SNI
  Spoofing**, in that order. xDi, PCK, UDP and Quic use the setup-link wizard;
  UDP's several-sockets question is short too, and the summary names the port
  range the kharej must open. **IP Spoofing and SNI Spoofing keep the classic
  wizard** — both ends by hand, the token made on kharej — since their answers
  belong to the route and are worked out on each machine.
- **The setup link now carries everything the two ends must agree on.** The
  GRE key, the exact error-correction pair, the MTU, the TCP segment cap and
  automatic MTU were missing, so a tunnel built from a link — or by the panel
  on a managed server — could differ between its two ends. Measured through
  the menus with one Iran and three kharej (Germany, USA, Finland on ports
  1245, 3294 and 3190): 1 GiB crossed each tunnel at the same time at about
  1 Gbit/s apiece, on `pck` and on `xdi`, with one session per tunnel and no
  drop after an idle minute.
- **The sign-in pages look like the panel.** The password and two-factor
  pages use the panel's own palette, glass card, mark and accent-bar ground,
  and follow its light or dark theme and its accent — they used to be a fixed
  red page that knew none of the panel's current accents. A wrong password or
  code now says so under the field instead of the page silently reappearing.
- **The panel installs as an app on a phone again.** Behind a trusted
  certificate (Let's Encrypt or your own), Android and desktop Chrome offer to
  install it — an **Install app** button appears in the header — and it opens
  full screen from the home screen, clear of the notch and the home
  indicator. On an iPhone the same button explains Share → Add to Home Screen.
  The rebuilt panel had stopped linking the manifest and registering the
  service worker, so no browser ever offered it. The app icon, the sign-in
  pages and the offline screen use the panel's own dark look.
- **The attribution line lives in the licence documents only.** "Based on
  BackPack by Amin Mohammadi (AminMGMT)" is gone from the TUI banner, the
  sign-in pages, the panel's About line and the version output. NOTICE now
  asks a modified version to keep it in its NOTICE and its README.

### Removed

- **Speed Test and Game Latency Test are gone, everywhere.** Both left the
  Manage menu; the panel's speed test went with them — the button on the
  tunnel card, its screen, `/api/speedtest` and `/api/speedtest/plan` — and a
  managed server no longer answers the `receive` operation that started the
  far-end sink. The game endpoint list (`/etc/backpack/game-endpoints.list`)
  is no longer read.

### Fixed

- **A reverse kharej built from a setup link outside the wizard lost its
  pairing.** "Setup from a link", the panel's paste box and a managed server's
  far end all went through a path that dropped simple auth, the smux version
  and kcp's exact error correction — and, when the link carried an MSS, sent a
  tuning block whose every zero replaced the preset: heartbeat off, Nagle on,
  kcp FEC off. The tuning block now carries only the settings it answers, on
  this machine and across the wire to a managed server.
- **A direct tunnel could stop for hours after the Iran server's clock was
  corrected.** Reported on v1.8.3 as "direct stops working after a while". The
  kharej refuses a handshake stamped no later than the last one it accepted,
  which is what makes a recorded handshake worthless. An Iran server whose
  clock ran fast and was set back by NTP, and whose tunnel then restarted
  (watchdog, Auto Refresh, reboot), sent only older stamps: every one was
  refused as a replay until the clock caught up, or the kharej was restarted.
  Once the kharej has no session left and such stamps have been refused for a
  minute, it now takes the Iran server's clock as it is, and says so in its
  log. While a session is up nothing changes.
- **After an update the menu was still the old version.** The menu that ran
  the update went on as the build it was started as — old version on the
  title, old screens — until it was quit and opened again. After an update, an
  install from a file or a rollback, pressing Enter now opens the installed
  binary in its place.
- **Install from a downloaded file always said "Version unknown".** The
  version flag prints the version and then the source link, and the whole of
  that was read as the version and refused. It reads the first line now, and
  the closing "now running" line no longer carries the link.
- **A reverse kharej set up from the Setup Link skipped its own questions.**
  Only a name was asked, so a ws/wss kharej behind a CDN could not be given
  its edge IP, a pck kharej its flag pattern or interface, and none of them a
  proxy or backup addresses. The link path now asks exactly what the manual
  path asks of this side; what the two ends share still comes from the link.
- **The reverse wizard wrote a tunnel whose forwarded port was already in
  use,** or was its own tunnel port, and the listener then failed to bind. It
  is refused before anything is written, in the wizard and the panel, as the
  direct wizard already did. Both checks now count only a port that is really
  held, not one a non-root process may not bind.
- **A kharej accepted a second direct tunnel on a UDP port another one
  listens on.** Two Iran servers set up with the default port 9000 left the
  second tunnel failing to bind and restarting for ever; the wizard, the panel
  and the setup link now refuse it and say which tunnel has the port.
- **A wizard left open when the session dropped asked the same question for
  ever.** A refused name — or a refused address in the spoofing screens — was
  asked again on every empty read once stdin had closed, burning a core. It
  now stops.
- **A port spread over several kharej could panic after two billion
  connections on a 32-bit build,** when the rotation counter no longer fitted
  an int.
- **Direct `pck` tunnels dropped and reconnected on their own.** A tunnel that
  heard nothing from its peer for 15 seconds started a new handshake, and a
  tunnel carrying only one-way traffic — or only the kernel's own chatter on
  the interface — looked exactly like one whose peer had died. It now asks the
  peer directly, under the current session, before tearing anything down, and
  keeps the session when the peer answers.
- **A second kharej never came up** when its config gave `local_ip` and
  `peer_ip` the same address, which a hand-filled kharej easily did. That is
  now refused when the config is loaded, and by the wizard and the panel, with
  the reason.
- **`xdi` did nothing behind a firewall that drops ICMP.** The kernel dropped
  the echoes before the tunnel could read them, and the tunnel waited with no
  error. Each end now inserts an `ACCEPT` rule for its own echoes only (same
  tag, same direction) and removes it on exit; where it cannot, the log names
  the rule in the way. The rules are counted per process, so several `xdi`
  tunnels share them safely.
- **A token mismatch was silent.** The listening side now logs that a handshake
  did not authenticate and that the tokens differ; an echo tagged for another
  tunnel is reported while no session exists; and a forwarded port says it is
  refusing connections because the tunnel is not up, not that the backend is
  unreachable.
- **Every `xdi` tunnel reported "peer moved" as it came up.** ICMP has no
  ports, so the kharej's address was read back as `1.2.3.4` after being dialled
  as `1.2.3.4:6999`, and the same server was logged as a move — which read as a
  fault on a tunnel that was working. Only a change of host is reported now.
- **A forwarded port already in use was accepted.** A tunnel forwarding the web
  panel's own `7777` started and then failed to bind, in a log nobody was
  reading. The wizard and the panel now refuse the port up front.
- **The main menu spun for ever when its input closed.** Run with a closed
  stdin — from a script, `< /dev/null`, a dropped SSH session — it printed
  "Invalid option" in a tight loop, taking a core and filling the disk with
  output (3.6 GB in one test). It now exits.

## v1.8.3 — 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Several kharej servers behind one Iran server, on a direct layer-3
  tunnel.** The Iran side of a direct tunnel dials, so each kharej is its own
  tunnel — its own interface and `10.10.N.0/30`, any carrier, `pck` included —
  and one forwarded port can now be served by all of them. Each new connection
  goes to the kharej with the fewest connections open, so bandwidth adds up:
  two kharej on `pck`, each limited to 300 Mbit/s, gave 267 Mbit/s apiece and
  **535 Mbit/s together** on the shared port. The wizard offers the sharing
  when the second kharej is given a port the first already forwards, the
  panel does it on its own, and the Iran summary now says which tunnel
  addresses the kharej has to enter (the kharej wizard proposed the first
  block free on its own machine, which for a second kharej was the wrong one,
  and the tunnel came up carrying nothing).

### Changed

- **pck is much faster.** Measured on a loopback pair in network namespaces,
  three runs each:
  - **Layer-3 pck, 16 parallel downloads: 742 → 1,300 Mbit/s**, with 60% less
    CPU on the Iran side and 43% less on kharej. One stream: 970 → 1,390.
  - **Reverse pck, 16 parallel downloads: 545 → 631 Mbit/s.**

  Three causes, found by profiling a loaded tunnel:
  - Every segment sent or received read the clock to stamp a "last seen" time
    that nothing ever read, and built a string to find its peer. On a VM whose
    clock is not the cheap kind that was 15% of the CPU on its own. Both are
    gone, which is also what reverse pck gains.
  - The layer-3 tunnel wrote received packets to its interface one at a time.
    It now reads the pck socket in batches (recvmmsg) and writes a whole
    batch to the interface in one call, which lets the kernel coalesce a
    flow's segments into large ones before its receive path sees them.
  - Sending took one syscall per segment; a batch now goes out in one
    (sendmmsg), with one clock read for the batch.
- **xdi (ICMP) is twice as fast** on a direct layer-3 tunnel: 16 parallel
  downloads 543 → 1,150 Mbit/s, 16 uploads 627 → 1,325, one stream
  582 → 1,112. It reads and sends its echoes in batches, as pck now does.
- **The xdi server no longer sends every upload back.** The client's data
  travels in Echo Requests, and the server's kernel answered each one with an
  Echo Reply carrying the whole payload. The client discarded them, but they
  had already crossed the path: every byte uploaded through xdi left the
  server twice. One iptables rule now drops exactly those — the tunnel's tag
  with the client's direction byte — and nothing else: pings to the server
  and across the tunnel still answer. With the batching, the server's CPU for
  a 16-stream upload fell from 17 to 7.7 CPU-seconds. Where the `u32` module is
  missing the rule does not install and the tunnel works as before.
- **The speed test measures with 8 connections at once** instead of one. One
  TCP connection measures its own window, which on a long or lossy path is far
  below what the tunnel carries — and a tunnel carrying a VPN is never carrying
  one connection. The result says how many streams it used, and an older
  receiver on the far end measures the same way.

### Fixed

- **A dead backend on a shared layer-3 port stalled connections.** The
  forwarder went round-robin and dialled every member in turn with a 10 s
  timeout, so with one of two kharej gone every second connection hung for ten
  seconds: ten connections took 50 s. A member whose dial fails is now set
  aside for 20 s, and while another is left to try a dial gives up after 3 s:
  the same ten took 3.1 s.

## v1.8.2 — 2026-09-24

Every finding of a section-by-section audit of the whole project, and the
mechanism that lets a fix like these reach a server that already exists.

That mechanism is the part worth reading first. Two of the fixes below change
nothing for a server that already exists, because what they correct is not in
the binary: it is a permission bit on a file written once at setup, and a kernel
value written once and never read back. `ip_local_port_range` is the case that
proves the point. It was corrected in v1.8.1, Health Check was taught to report
it, and the engine went on widening it back on every single tunnel start — so an
operator could optimize the machine, pass its own check, and be wide again the
moment a tunnel restarted. An update now corrects the machine as well as the
binary.

Verified on a real tunnel, not only in tests: all six layer-3 carriers — `udp`,
`quic`, `pck`, `sni`, `xdi` and `spoof` — carried a 5 MB payload byte-identical
over a TUN device in a network namespace, with no packet loss on a ping across
the tunnel. That path had never been exercised end to end before, because the
raw-socket carriers need capabilities a test process does not have.

### Security

- **Any Telegram admin with write access could read the panel password** from
  the Web UI screen, or take a backup that carries it — and the panel password
  is everything, including who else gets in. The same gap the panel's `write`
  tokens had. Both are now the bot owner's alone; added admins keep running the
  tunnels.

- **A release signature did not say which release it was for.** It covered the
  checksum list, which names archives but not versions, so a mirror or proxy —
  which is how restricted networks fetch releases — could serve an older
  release's genuine archive, checksums and signature under a newer tag, and
  every updater would verify and install it: a downgrade signed by the
  publisher. The tag is now part of what is signed. No release carried a
  signature before this one, so nothing already installed depends on the old
  form.

- **The reverse QUIC transport handed its token to anything that terminated
  the TLS.** The client does not verify the server's certificate, and then
  sent the token as its control claim and on every data stream, and the server
  echoed it back. It now proves the token with an HMAC over keying material
  exported from the TLS session, as WSS already did, and the server answers with
  a proof of its own; a man in the middle holds a different session with each
  end and gets nothing usable. A test puts a real QUIC man in the middle between
  the two and checks the tunnel does not come up and the token never crosses
  it — it did both before. **Upgrade the Iran server first**: a new server
  still accepts an older client's token, a new client never sends one.
- **A recorded layer-3 handshake could be replayed for ever.** Protocol v2 puts
  a monotonic timestamp inside the dialler's encrypted handshake payload and
  the listener refuses one that does not advance (WireGuard's rule); once it has
  seen one, it refuses the older, untimestamped handshake too. It interoperates
  with v1.8.1 in both directions: against an old listener the dialler falls back
  on that listener's own authenticated answer — never on silence, so the path
  cannot force it — and retries v2 every half hour. Verified against a real
  v1.8.1 binary each way.
- **The audit record is a hash chain.** Editing or deleting a line is shown at
  the top of the record, and every line forwarded to Telegram carries the head
  of the chain, so even a consistent rewrite disagrees with the copies off the
  machine.

- **A `write` API token could make itself `admin`.** `/api/tokens` and
  `/api/audit` were guarded at `admin`, but everything else that decides who gets
  in sat at `write`: the panel password, the second factor, the signed-in
  devices, the Telegram admin list, the panel's port and certificate, and backup
  export and restore. A backup carries the password out, and a restore replaces
  every credential file, so any one of them turned a `write` token into the
  panel password — which is `admin`. They are all `admin` now, and the whole
  route table is tested as it is wired (`internal/webui/routes_test.go`), not
  only the guard on its own. The refusal names the scope held and the scope
  needed instead of calling every credential "read-only".
- **Changing the panel password or the second factor was never forwarded off the
  machine.** The forwarding list named `/api/security`, which is not a route. It
  now names the real ones, and every `admin` route is on it.
- **An audit line written from the browser said only "the panel".** It now names
  the session by the id the signed-in devices list shows, so a line can be traced
  to a device and that device signed out.

- **The Go toolchain moved from 1.26.0 to 1.26.6, which closes 24 known
  vulnerabilities.** Every one of them is in the standard library, every one was
  already fixed upstream, and every one is on code this product actually runs —
  `net/http`, `crypto/tls`, `crypto/x509`, `html/template`, `net/url`,
  `encoding/asn1`. The panel serves HTTP over TLS with HTML templates and the
  updater fetches releases over HTTPS, so none of it was theoretical.

  Nothing in the repository was going to notice. `govulncheck` runs in CI now
  and fails the build, and because it reports only what the code can actually
  reach, a failure means something worth reading rather than a list to
  acknowledge.

  The pinned checksums in `install.sh` moved with it, verified against the real
  archive rather than copied from an index.

- **Eight fuzz targets on the parsers that read attacker-controlled bytes**, and
  they found two bugs in the first minute.

  `parseReplyPayload` accepted a *negative* protocol version. `Atoi` is happy
  with `-1`, and version agreement takes the lower of the two — so a peer
  announcing `v-1` negotiated the session down to a version that does not exist
  and then behaved as legacy, which is the one outcome version negotiation was
  built to prevent. The downgrade check did not catch it because it looks at the
  echo of *our* announcement, not at the sanity of theirs.

  And **the setup link was silently corrupting tokens.** Its payload is JSON,
  and `encoding/json` replaces any byte sequence that is not valid UTF-8 with a
  replacement character, without a word. A token carrying one stray byte — from
  a paste, or a terminal in another encoding — arrived at the other end as a
  *different* token, and the tunnel then refused every connection for the one
  reason neither machine reports: the two ends do not hold the same secret. The
  entire purpose of a setup link is to remove the manual retyping step. It
  refuses now instead, and checks every field rather than the four the first
  version of the guard happened to name.


- **A read-only Telegram admin could read the web panel's password.** The bot
  splits its admins into those who may act and those who may only look, and the
  split was written as "every screen, no actions" — so every `nav:` screen was
  answered for anyone on the admin list, and only the buttons that change
  something were checked. That reading is right for eleven of the twelve
  screens, which are readings: how much traffic, which tunnels are up, what the
  last alert said.

  The Web Panel screen is not a reading. It prints the panel's password in plain
  text, and the panel is root on that machine — every tunnel and its token, the
  backups, the updater, the bot's own settings. So the account that had
  deliberately been denied the bot's restart button could take the whole server
  by opening a different screen, and `/webui` reached it without a button to
  notice. A screen that hands over a credential is now checked against the same
  permission every action is.

- **The Telegram status report no longer carries the panel password.** Gating
  the Web Panel screen closed the door that was written as a door, and it was
  not the only way in. `StatusText` is two things at once: the Overview screen,
  which any account on the admin list can open and which the bot leads with, and
  the scheduled report, which is sent unprompted to every recipient on a timer.
  Both reach a read-only admin, so the credential was on the screen in front of
  them before they pressed anything and arrived again by itself every few hours.

  The report gives the panel's address now. The password lives on the one screen
  that checks who is asking.

- **A cross-site request can no longer change anything, and can no longer sign
  an operator out.** What stopped one was a chain of three things, each of which
  holds: the session cookie is `SameSite=Lax` and so is not sent on a cross-site
  POST, every mutating handler enforces POST, and the panel answers only under a
  path nobody can guess. The shape of that is worth noticing — the last link is
  a secret in the address bar, which makes the base path a load-bearing control
  rather than the obscurity it is described as.

  A browser says where a request came from and an attacker's page cannot make it
  say otherwise, so that is checked now: a cross-site write is refused outright.
  Signing out is the exception that proves it, because it changes state on a GET
  and has to stay a link — under `SameSite=Lax` a cross-site top-level
  navigation still carries the cookie, which is exactly what Lax is for. It is
  checked where it is handled. Anything that is not a browser — a script, a peer
  panel holding the remote access token, curl — sends no such header and is
  unaffected.

- **Every transport compares the tunnel's token in constant time.** `tcp` and
  `tcpmux` went through a helper written for it; `udp`, `kcp` and `quic` used a
  plain `!=`. Whether a timing difference over those three is realistically
  exploitable is worth arguing about and is the wrong question to settle in five
  places: two ways of comparing the only credential a tunnel has is a difference
  nobody chose, and the cheaper of the two is the one that is harder to reason
  about.

- **Tunnel configs are written `0600`.** A tunnel's config holds its token, and
  on `tcp`, `udp` and `kcp` that token is the whole of what authorises a
  connection to it. Every other file this program writes that holds a secret was
  already `0600` — `telegram.json`, `webui.json`, the node registry, the TLS
  key, the backups — and the tunnel configs alone were `0644`, so any account on
  the box could read every token on it. Nine call sites across five files, which
  is how they came to disagree; the mode is one constant now. Existing configs
  are tightened by the migration below.

  They are also written atomically now. These files are polled every two seconds
  by the reload watcher and read on a timer by the panel and the monitor, and
  five of the writers used a plain `os.WriteFile` while the atomic helper this
  repository already has says in its own documentation that it exists for
  exactly this.

### Added

- **The tool now measures whether UDP works here instead of asking you to.**

  Every recommendation for a lossy link is a UDP carrier — KCP, QUIC, plain UDP
  — and every one of them carried the same sentence: *"KCP runs over UDP — if
  your provider throttles UDP this will be worse, not better, so test it before
  committing."* That was an admission. The tool measured the path with TCP,
  concluded the link was lossy, recommended a UDP carrier, and then told the
  operator to go and find out something the tool had not asked — which they
  mostly cannot, because the far end refuses to answer an unauthenticated
  datagram by design and there is nothing to test against.

  It asks now: a DNS query to three public resolvers on different networks,
  stopping at the first answer. If UDP leaves the machine and comes back, the
  reading is reported and the caveat is gone. If none of them answer, **the
  recommendation moves** — a UDP carrier there is not a slower choice, it is one
  that never comes up — and it says what it moved off, that this is the second
  best answer for this link, and that `pck` carries the same KCP inside
  TCP-shaped packets and needs no UDP at all.

  A caveat that has been answered and is still printed teaches people to skip
  caveats, so both of the ones this measurement answers are removed rather than
  left beside it. A probe that could not be taken changes nothing, which is not
  the same as one that failed.

  What it does not claim, and says so where the code is: it answers "can UDP
  leave here", not "can UDP reach that port on that server". The narrower
  question needs a far end that will answer.

- **The engine has a local control socket, and the watchdog has a rung below
  restarting it.** `/run/backpack/<name>.sock`, 0600, in a directory only root
  can enter.

  The graduated response to a stalled tunnel had one lever and said so: an
  engine ran as its own process with no way to be asked for anything, so the
  only thing the watchdog could do was `systemctl restart`. A ladder whose rungs
  are all the same rung.

  The engine can now be asked to restart its own transport. That keeps the
  process, its metrics history, its uptime, its accumulated counters and its log
  continuity, and it clears every stall that is about the transport rather than
  about the path — which is most of them. A stall that clears there never
  reaches the `systemctl` rung.

  It is safe because it is not a new way of stopping a transport: a restart
  asked for over the socket ends the running generation exactly as a
  configuration change does, which is the path with years of production behind
  it. And it degrades — an engine too old to have a socket falls straight
  through to the next rung, which is the ordinary state of a machine mid-update,
  since the monitor and the engines are separate units and are not updated in
  the same instant.

  **"Rebuild the pool" is deliberately absent.** The engine cannot genuinely do
  it, and an operation that reports success and changes nothing is worse than
  one that does not exist: a rung that does nothing is a rung whose failure is
  invisible.

- **The panel can tell you whether the fleet is running what you asked for.**
  `Servers → Check the fleet`.

  Every fleet operation was a one-way instruction: the panel told a server to
  create a tunnel, the server said it had, and that was the end of it. Nothing
  remembered the instruction, so nothing could notice that it had stopped being
  true — a tunnel removed on the far machine by somebody with a terminal, a unit
  disabled during an incident and never re-enabled, an apply that reported
  success and then lost its config to a rollback. All of them leave a fleet that
  looks correct on the panel and is not, and the only way to find out was to go
  and look.

  The panel now writes down what it asked for, and the report compares that with
  what each server says it has: missing, stopped, running when it was stopped,
  changed beyond what was written, or a tunnel this panel did not create.

  **It changes nothing.** That is a decision rather than an unfinished feature:
  something that re-applied on its own would be a loop that can fight an
  operator in the middle of a change, and what it would be fighting over is the
  tunnel that operator is reaching the machine through.

  Two things it deliberately does not call drift, because either would turn a
  useful report into one nobody opens: a field an older node does not report,
  and a tunnel that was stopped from the panel on purpose. A server that could
  not be reached is listed apart from one that has drifted — a machine that is
  down has not changed, it is simply not answering.

- **The layer-3 carrier hands whole runs of packets to the kernel to cut up.**
  UDP segmentation offload, on the send path.

  This is the change that says the `sendmmsg` conclusion was only half right.
  That one removed seven eighths of the syscalls and bought no measurable
  throughput, and the reason is that the cost is not the syscall — it is **per
  datagram, inside the kernel**: a copy into the socket buffer and a walk down
  the protocol stack, each, for every datagram. Batching the *calls* does
  nothing about that.

  `UDP_SEGMENT` does. Measured three ways, so the gain could not be mistaken for
  a bigger batch: at the **same batch and the same number of syscalls it is
  three to four times the rate**, with fewer syscalls on top of that at a longer
  run. The middle figure is the one that decided it.

  Every segment but the last has to be the same size — that is the mechanism,
  not the implementation — so the carrier splits a batch into as many segmented
  writes as it can rather than taking one and refusing the rest. A *short*
  packet does not merely end a run, it is that run's last segment, because the
  kernel's remainder is the final datagram; a batch of full-sized packets with
  an acknowledgement in the middle goes out as two segmented writes rather than
  as none.

  Support is found out by trying, because it depends on the kernel, the address
  family and the route: the first refusal turns it off for the life of the
  socket and re-sends the same batch the old way, so nothing is dropped.

  Verified on a real TUN in a network namespace as well as in tests — `udp` and
  `quic` carriers, ping plus 2 MB byte-identical.

- **Every document has a Persian summary — 38 of 38, up from 24.** The people
  who run this are Iranian, and a page that exists only in English is a page a
  good part of its audience reads with a dictionary open. `troubleshooting.md`
  is the clearest case: it is read when something is already broken, which is
  exactly when reading a second language is hardest.

  They are summaries rather than translations, and that is a decision. A full
  translation is a second copy to keep in step, and a second copy of a
  configuration reference that has quietly fallen behind is worse than none.
  Each one carries the argument of its page — what the thing is, when you want
  it, and what will go wrong.

  The fourteen that were missing were not an oversight anybody could see,
  because nothing listed them. A test lists them now, and checks the block is
  marked right-to-left; without that it renders as left-aligned text with the
  punctuation in the wrong places. `config-reference.md` is generated, so its
  note is generated with it — anything hand-added to that file is lost on the
  next regeneration.

- **Two-factor sign-in for the panel.** The panel is root on the machine —
  everything it can do, it does as root — and it was behind one password, on a
  port that has to be reachable. A code from an authenticator app is now the
  second thing somebody would have to have.

  It is RFC 6238, with no dependency added: a TOTP is an HMAC over a counter and
  a truncation, the algorithm has not changed since 2011, and the RFC's own
  published test vectors are the test — so a drift that would stop every phone
  in a fleet at once cannot get through. SHA-1, six digits, thirty seconds,
  because that is what every app defaults to and an operator who has to
  hand-configure an entry is an operator who leaves the feature off.

  **Ten recovery codes come with it, shown once and stored hashed.** A second
  factor whose only key is a phone is a way to lose a server. They are accepted
  in the same box as a code, because somebody reaching for one has already lost
  the phone and should not have to find a different field, and each one works
  exactly once.

  **And there is a way back that does not depend on either.** If the phone and
  the codes are both gone, CLI → Web Panel → Two-factor sign-in turns it off
  from the machine itself. That asks for no password on purpose: anyone who can
  run it is already root and can read the file the secret is in, so a prompt
  would protect nothing and would strand an operator who had also forgotten the
  password.

  Enrolment does not take effect until a code proves the app actually holds the
  secret, so a tab closed after the QR code leaves the panel exactly as it was.
  Turning it *off* from the panel needs the password again, because a stolen
  session must not be able to quietly remove the thing that would have stopped
  it.

- **Chaos tests: the faults that are not network faults.** The existing fault
  suite covers loss, latency, jitter and a backend that accepts and then says
  nothing. Those are the conditions a tunnel is designed for. These are the ones
  that take one down, and none of them had a test.

  *A peer killed mid-transfer* — a client destroyed with 4 MB in flight, three
  times over. What is checked is not only that it comes back: the interrupted
  transfer has to **fail** rather than hang, because a caller left blocked on a
  dead tunnel never finds out; the server has to take a fourth client
  afterwards; and the open-descriptor count must not climb with each life, which
  is the failure that actually happens — recovering every time while keeping
  something from each previous one.

  *A backend that resets instead of closing* — `SO_LINGER 0`, which is what a
  killed process produces. The tunnel has to pass that through rather than
  absorb it.

  *A full disk*, against the metrics collector: it keeps ticking through the
  failures, the snapshot already written stays intact, and it writes again on
  its own once there is room. A collector that stopped on the first error would
  leave a healthy tunnel looking dead to the watchdog for the life of the
  process.

  *Out of file descriptors*, with a real `RLIMIT_NOFILE`. The limit is
  process-wide, so the test re-runs itself as a child, exhausts the descriptors
  there, and checks the tunnel neither dies nor spins and recovers unaided.

- **JSON logs say which tunnel they came from.** Every line in JSON format now
  carries `tunnel`, `role`, `transport` and `host` alongside the timestamp,
  level and message.

  JSON output has existed for a while and there was not much anyone could do
  with it. An operator with five servers who shipped all five journals to one
  place got a single stream in which no line said which machine or which tunnel
  produced it — so searching it meant already knowing which server to look at,
  which is the problem shipping was supposed to solve.

  The field names are an interface, not an implementation detail: a dashboard,
  an alert rule or a line in a runbook is written against them, and renaming one
  would break all of them on the update that shipped it with nothing failing
  anywhere. They are documented in `docs/log-schema.md` — which also carries a
  promtail and a vector recipe, both reading journald — and a test fails if one
  is renamed.

  The human-readable format is untouched. It is read by somebody on the server
  they are already logged into, who knows all four and would only have them
  repeated on every line.

- **The panel's JavaScript has tests.** Twenty-seven of them, in
  `internal/webui/paneltest/`, run by `go test ./internal/webui` and written as
  plain `node --test` — no `package.json`, no `node_modules`, no dependency of
  any kind. A Go toolchain remains the only thing this repository requires; the
  test skips where node is not installed.

  Three files cover the modules that decide what a number or a state *means* —
  formatting, tunnel state, routing. Those are shared by every screen, so a unit
  mistake in one of them is wrong on all of them at once, and there is no DOM
  involved in any of it.

  The fourth is a static wiring check, and it is the one that earns its keep.
  The panel has no build step — a deliberate choice, and this is its cost:
  nothing notices an import naming a file that does not exist, or a function
  exported and never called. Both have happened. It now checks that every module
  is imported by something, every export is referenced elsewhere, and every
  relative import resolves. It found two dead exports on its first run.

- **The reverse transports are now tested over a real network path, not
  loopback.** `tools/transporttest/` builds two network namespaces joined by a
  veth pair, applies loss and latency with `tc netem`, runs an actual reverse
  tunnel between them and pushes 2 MB through a forwarded port, comparing it
  byte for byte at the other end.

  Loopback has a 65536-byte MTU, loses nothing and reorders nothing, which is
  the opposite of the path this product exists for. Every transport passes
  there, and the failures that matter in the field are precisely the ones it
  cannot produce.

  Three passes over nine transports — a real MTU, a 1280-byte MTU, and 2% loss
  with 20 ms of latency — twenty-seven of twenty-seven. The QUIC fault below is
  what the first run found.

- **`tools/mutate` — mutation testing.** Coverage says a line ran; it says
  nothing about whether a test would have noticed had that line been wrong, and
  a test that exercises code without asserting on the result raises coverage by
  exactly as much as one that checks everything.

  It enumerates comparison, connective, sign and integer-boundary mutations from
  the AST and runs each through `go test -overlay`, so the source tree is never
  written to and an interrupted run leaves nothing to clean up. It refuses to
  report a score for a suite that was already failing, and counts mutants that
  did not compile separately from mutants that were killed.

  Pointed at the fallback chain it scored 59.5%, and the survivors were not
  noise. `Single()` — which decides whether the rotation machinery runs at all —
  could have its comparison inverted, so a three-candidate chain would report
  itself as having nothing to fall back to, and no test noticed. The window
  arithmetic had the same shape of hole: the rendezvous test asserts a bound, so
  "two candidates" could be treated as "one" and a client would hold a blocked
  carrier for the server's whole dwell. Both are closed, and the score is 67.6%.

- **`docs/design-decisions.md` — what Backpack deliberately does not do.** The
  seventeen proposals that were considered seriously and turned down, each with
  the reason, plus the three facts every one of them rests on and the licence
  reality that decides what can be sold. Features that get built stop being
  interesting; the reasons for the ones that were refused otherwise have to be
  re-derived every time somebody proposes them again.

- **`docs/web-panel-screens.md` and `img/panel-map.svg` — the panel, screen by
  screen.** All seventeen screens: the three sections in the dock, the seven
  per-tunnel dialogs and the seven installation ones, each with its address,
  what it shows, and the CLI entry that does the same job.

  Screenshots are deliberately not part of it. A photograph of a panel goes
  stale on the next restyle and nothing detects it; this map cannot, because a
  test reads the routes out of `panel/js/main.js` and the addresses out of the
  document and fails when they disagree.


- **`backpack tunnel status` now says whether the tunnel is carrying anything.**
  It reported the name, the role, the transport, the address and `state: online`
  — which is exactly the answer that is wrong in the failure this product cares
  about most. From a terminal there was no way to ask the first question anybody
  asks about a tunnel that looks healthy.

  It now shows the peer, bytes in and bytes out *separately* — one climbing
  while the other is frozen is a stall, and both frozen is an idle tunnel, which
  is not a fault — how old the reading is, and the failing last hop with the
  shape of the failure: `refused` is a service that is not running, `timeout` is
  usually a firewall on the same machine, and the two have different fixes. A
  reading too old to mean anything is left out rather than shown, because a
  figure on a screen is read as now.

- **A troubleshooting runbook**, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, ordered by how often
  each cause is actually the answer rather than by how interesting it is.


- **The pairing step three transports had a copy of is now written once.** Seven
  transports on the server side repeat accept → pair → admit → relay → release
  by copy, and the copies have already proved they drift: the connection-slot
  release on a pairing timeout was missing from four of the seven, the timeout
  itself could not fire in the one case it exists for — the age was checked
  once and then the loop blocked, so on a pool that had run dry nothing ever
  woke up — and a run ending while a connection sat there leaked one socket and
  one slot per parked connection on every restart. Each was found and fixed
  once per copy, on three separate occasions.

  `tcp`, `ws` and `quic` now share one state machine. What stays per transport
  is what genuinely differs: how the backend address is announced, how an
  unusable tunnel connection is dropped, and the relay itself. The mux
  transports are deliberately left alone — they open a stream on a session they
  already hold, so nothing is ever parked, which is a different lifecycle and
  not a copy of this one.

- **The panel no longer owns the fleet.** `internal/webui` served HTML *and*
  owned the managed servers: the runner that reaches them, the loop that
  measures the path to each one, and the state of every long-running operation
  all lived in package-level variables next to HTTP handlers. Nothing was broken
  by that, and everything built on top of it made the separation harder — each
  new operations feature added one more package-level variable to a package
  whose job is to render a page.

  There is a `internal/control` now, and it is a **package** boundary rather
  than a service boundary: no new process, no socket, no daemon, and the
  single-binary install is untouched. What changes is that a second reader — a
  CLI, an API, the monitor — becomes a caller rather than a rewrite.

  It also brings **one job abstraction** for operations that outlive the request
  that started them, with progress, cancellation and a memory of what happened
  last time. There were two hand-rolled versions of this and a third on the way;
  three ad-hoc versions of the same thing is how they drift. The link test can
  now answer "what is happening, *or what just happened*", which the old one
  could not: it forgot the last result the moment the next test started.

- **The panel has scopes, API tokens and a record of what was done.** It had one
  password and one level of access: anyone who could open it could change
  anything, and nothing was written down afterwards — so "who restarted the
  tunnel at three in the morning" had no answer.

  Every request is now authorised at one function against one of three scopes:
  read, write, admin. Handing out a credential is separate from using one, so a
  write credential cannot mint itself a better one. The vocabulary is the
  Telegram bot's, ported rather than reinvented — two permission models in one
  product is how a gap opens between them.

  **The record is written by that same function, not by the handlers.** A log
  each handler writes for itself has one hole per handler somebody forgot to
  update, and those holes are invisible until the day somebody goes looking.
  Written at the choke point, the only way to act without being recorded is to
  act without being authorised. Reads are not recorded — the panel polls itself,
  and they would bury the lines that matter — but refused attempts are.

  **API tokens are back, and `/metrics` works again.** The panel had a read-only
  token once and it was removed for good reason: nothing issued it, so nothing
  rotated it. That left `/metrics` — an endpoint built for scrapers — behind a
  session cookie no scraper has. The new ones address the reasons rather than
  repeating them: a name and an expiry are both required, last use is recorded
  so a dead token is recognisable, and they are listed on a screen operators
  actually open. Only the SHA-256 is stored, so a token cannot leak with a
  backup, and the secret is shown exactly once. See `docs/access-control.md`.

- **Fleet upgrades are staged: one server first, watched, then the rest in
  waves.** "Upgrade all" replaced the binary on every managed server at once, in
  parallel, and told you afterwards which ones had failed. That is the right
  shape for a fleet of one and an act of faith for a fleet of twenty — a release
  with a fault in it takes every server down before anybody has read the first
  error, and the per-node rollback that already exists cannot help, because by
  then every node has rolled itself back and nobody knows into what.

  Now one server goes first, is left alone for a soak window, and is checked
  before anything else is touched — and *checked* means it answers **and** the
  tunnels that are supposed to be running on it are running, because a binary
  that comes back with dead tunnels behind it is exactly what staging is for.
  The rest follow in waves, each verified, halting when one fails. The plan is
  worked out and readable before anything happens.

  A server can also be **pinned** to hold it back, with a reason that is
  required and is shown on its card. There is always a reason a machine is
  deliberately behind, and it used to live in whoever set it up.

  While wiring this up: the fleet upgrade had no button. `nodeUpgradeAll` was
  exported by the panel's API layer and called from nowhere at all.

- **The layer-3 receive path reads several datagrams per syscall.** The comment
  that used to explain why it could not was right about *timer-based* batching —
  holding packets back to gather them trades latency for syscalls on the path
  where latency is the thing being protected — and it does not apply to
  `recvmmsg`, which waits exactly as long as a single read would and then takes
  whatever else has already arrived. An idle tunnel pays nothing.

  Measured on 40,000 1200-byte datagrams: 59 → 214 kpps. The rate is the smaller
  half of the result. Reading one at a time, the receive loop could not keep up
  with the sender and the socket dropped 12,318 of the 40,000; the batched path
  took every one. A tunnel losing packets inside its own receive loop looks
  exactly like a lossy path from the outside, which is the most expensive kind
  of fault to chase.

  Linux only, plain `udp` carrier only, and every other carrier reads exactly as
  it did before — including if the batch path refuses at runtime, which costs
  throughput rather than the tunnel. All six layer-3 carriers were re-run over
  real raw sockets in a network namespace afterwards.

- **A tunnel can now change carrier by itself when the one it is on stops
  getting through.** This was the gap between what the product is for and what
  the engine would actually do: a tunnel is pinned to one transport, so when
  that transport is the one being filtered it retried it for ever and the
  operator was the failover mechanism — at three in the morning, from a phone,
  on a connection that is also being filtered.

  `fallback_transports` is an ordered list of carriers the tunnel may move to.
  Both ends carry the same list. They never tell each other where they are: the
  server holds each candidate for `fallback_dwell` while the other end tries the
  whole list inside that window, so the two meet within one dwell with nothing
  new on the wire and no negotiation to get wrong. Candidates run one at a time
  because starting a transport binds the forwarded ports, and the outgoing one
  is given time to let go of them before the next binds.

  It is a better *connect*, not live switching — there is no session migration
  here. A carrier that is up is left alone, including through a short drop,
  because every transport already reconnects on its own and rotating through a
  blip would turn a short outage into a long one. Rotation resumes only after a
  working carrier has been down for five minutes.

  Off unless configured, and a tunnel without a list runs exactly the code it
  ran before. Set it from `Manage tunnels → Transport fallback chain` on either
  end; see `docs/transport-fallback.md`.

- **An update now corrects the machine it is installed on, not only the binary.**
  A fix that changes what a new install writes reaches nobody who is already
  running. The servers that need it most are the ones that have been running
  longest, and those are exactly the ones nothing rewrites.

  So an update applies a list of corrections to what an older version left
  behind: the tunnel configs on disk, and machine state no config holds. It
  applies them without asking, and that is deliberate — everything on the list
  is a value this program itself wrote and later decided was wrong, so a setting
  the operator never chose is not one they should have to choose again. It is
  also the limit: a migration that would overwrite a real decision does not
  belong on the list, and each one says in its own words how it tells the two
  apart. The ephemeral port range, for one, is corrected only when it reads back
  the exact string the engine used to write.

  Nothing is remembered between runs. A marker file recording "already applied"
  would be wrong in both directions — a config restored from an older backup
  would be skipped, and a value forced back by hand would stay forced back — so
  every migration is idempotent, runs on every update, and writes only when
  something is actually different. A migration that rewrites a config files what
  it replaced in that tunnel's configuration history first, so an update that
  changes a config is in the panel's Undo list like any other edit. It runs
  before the tunnels restart, so they come back up on the corrected settings, and
  it runs on the offline install too — that path is taken on servers that cannot
  reach GitHub at all, which are the least likely to have anything else come
  along and fix them. Nothing it does can fail an update; everything it changes,
  and everything it tried and could not, is logged.

  This release ships two migrations: the config permissions above, and the
  ephemeral port range below.

- **The tunnel's own port can be bound to one address, the way a forwarded port
  already could.** On a server with two public addresses, the operator wants the
  control channel on one and the user-facing port on the other — both on 443, so
  the control channel blends in as HTTPS like everything else. The forwarded
  ports have taken an address for a while: `85.10.11.61:443=127.0.0.1:2053`
  binds that one and nothing else. The control port could not. Every path that
  produced a bind address wrote `0.0.0.0` and joined the port onto it, so both
  halves ended up asking for `0.0.0.0:443` and the second one got
  `bind: address already in use`.

  Almost nothing in the engine needed changing for this, which is the part worth
  knowing: `bind_addr` is handed to the listener as it stands and has always
  accepted an address, the reload path's port settling was already written in
  terms of a full address, and the check that refuses two tunnels sharing a port
  already compared host and port together. The documentation even described the
  arrangement — and then said to set it by editing the config, because the
  wizard only offered the two wildcards. What was missing was a way to say it.

  So the **Tunnel port** field takes `85.10.11.51:443` wherever it is asked for:
  the setup wizard, the CLI's edit screen, and the panel's create and edit forms.
  A port on its own still means every interface, which is what every existing
  tunnel has and what every existing config keeps. One parser reads both forms,
  and every one of those four entry points goes through it rather than each
  deciding for itself what an address is.

  Four decisions in it are worth recording, because each one is a place the
  obvious behaviour would have been wrong:

  The "listen on IPv6 as well" switch chooses between the `0.0.0.0` and `::`
  wildcards and nothing else. An operator who named an address has answered that
  question already, and moving it to a wildcard because a checkbox was ticked
  would be ignoring what they typed. The wizard stops asking once an address is
  given.

  Changing only the port on a tunnel that is pinned keeps it pinned, and the CLI
  offers the address back as part of the default so that pressing Enter cannot
  quietly widen it. Widening is said out loud instead: `0.0.0.0:443`.

  A client is refused rather than obliged. Its tunnel port is the port on the
  *server* — it binds nothing — so an address there is aimed at a different
  setting, and it is told which one.

  A host must be an IP literal; a name is refused. A bind address is a local
  interface, and a name that resolves to an address this machine does not have
  fails inside the listener with "cannot assign requested address", an error that
  says nothing about the name that caused it.

  Three things that report on a port moved with it. The check that refuses a
  port already in use now asks about the address the tunnel will actually bind,
  because asking about `:443` when the answer is `85.10.11.51:443` produces
  exactly the refusal this feature exists to get past. Health Check does the
  same, and gained a warning for a tunnel pinned to an address this server does
  not currently hold — a warning and not a failure, because a floating address,
  a VIP that keepalived has not claimed, and an interface that comes up later
  are all real, and `ip_nonlocal_bind` exists so that binding one can be made to
  work. And a bind that fails because the address is not on the machine now says
  so in those words, with `ip -brief address` to check it against, instead of
  passing the kernel's errno through.

  One thing deliberately did not move: the port a tunnel reports to the other
  end, and the port the panel pairs two ends on, are still the number alone. The
  far end knows which port it dials and has no idea which of this machine's
  addresses that port was bound to, so folding the address into it would have
  stopped every pinned tunnel from matching its own other half.

- **Releases are signed now, and the updater requires it.** The machinery has
  been in place since this release opened: every release carries a SHA256SUMS
  file, the updater refuses an archive whose hash is not in it, and CI signs
  that list. What was missing was the key, so `releasesAreSigned()` was false and
  the signature check returned nil on every update — checksums only, which the
  updater said out loud.

  There is a key now. The consequence is worth stating plainly rather than
  discovering: **from this build on, a release without a valid signature is
  refused rather than warned about.** That is the correct behaviour and it is a
  one-way door — the signing secret has to be in place before the next tag, or
  that release installs nowhere. Rotating later is the same operation and is not
  free either: a machine on an older binary trusts the old key, so a new one has
  to ship in a release still signed by the old.

  Why it matters is the part the checksum alone could not cover. The list travels
  the same channel as the thing it describes, and on a blocked network that
  channel is somebody else's mirror. A mirror that can substitute the archive can
  substitute the list beside it, and the two then agree with each other. A
  signature does not travel that channel: it is checked against a key that
  arrived with the binary already running.

- **The attribution and the name are now written down, and enforced.** The
  licence has always been AGPL-3.0 and that has not changed — the text in
  `LICENSE` is untouched, deliberately, because part of the tunnel data plane
  derives from prior AGPL/GPL work and editing the licence is not ours to do.

  What is new is two additional terms in `NOTICE`, both of them things Section 7
  of that licence expressly permits and neither of them taking away anything it
  grants. Under 7(b), a modified version has to keep one line — "Based on
  BackPack by Amin Mohammadi (AminMGMT)" — in its NOTICE, its README, its
  version output, and the notices its panel shows the people using it. Under
  7(e), the name and the logo are not licensed with the code: a fork is welcome
  and needs a name of its own. `TRADEMARK.md` sets out the detail, including the
  parts that need no permission at all — saying truthfully that your work is
  based on, forked from or compatible with BackPack is always fine.

  A requirement stated in a file and enforced by nothing is one that disappears
  the first time somebody tidies a template, so there is a test. It checks that
  the same sentence appears in all five places, that it is one sentence rather
  than five that have drifted, that `LICENSE` is still the unmodified AGPL text,
  and that the additional terms still cite the section that permits them — which
  is what distinguishes them from the further restrictions Section 7 forbids.
  Removing the line is a failing build, for a fork and for us.

  The panel gained a line of its own on the login page as well. That one is
  Section 13's: a network service has to show the people interacting with it
  where the source is, and the login page is the first thing anybody reaches.

### Changed

- **Adding a server to the fleet is a decision, not a form handler.** It moved
  to `control.Fleet.Join`, which is the package that owns the fleet.

  It is the one fleet action with real logic in it: reach the machine while the
  operator is still looking at the form, install Backpack when the machine has
  none, and take the entry back out when it cannot be reached at all — because a
  fleet entry that has never worked is not a server, it is a typo, and leaving
  it is how a fleet fills with servers that do nothing and say nothing about
  why.

  None of that is about HTTP. Being reachable only through a POST is why
  anything else that wanted to add a server had to drive the panel or write the
  sequence again, and a sequence written twice is one where the second copy
  forgets the back-out. The three ways it can fail are now named apart, because
  they have three different fixes: a rejected name or port is the operator's to
  correct, a machine that will not answer is a credential or a firewall, and a
  failed install is the far machine's own words.

- **The seven client transports share one pool-sizing loop.** Each kept its own
  copy of the loop that decides how big the connection pool should be — the same
  two tickers, the same four factors, the same growth and shrink conditions.
  495 lines removed, 84 left.

  Three of the seven were still identical. The other four had each been edited
  at a different time, and two of the differences were faults rather than
  formatting:

  **A udp tunnel never reported its pool**, so the panel's connection-pool card
  was not empty or zero on one — it was absent, while every other transport had
  one. **And it never grew its pool on throughput**: the signal that lets a pool
  grow when its connections are each working hard, rather than only when
  somebody is waiting for one, was added to the others and not to it, so a udp
  tunnel under sustained load sat at its configured size while the same load
  grew every other transport's pool. Both are fixed by having one copy.

  The test that should have caught the first of those was excluding the only
  case it would have found: it left udp out of its list with the comment that
  udp "has no pool maintainer at all", which it has had all along. It covers all
  seven now, and checks that each delegates rather than checking seven copies
  for the same call.

- **The three mux transports share one session loop.** `tcpmux`, `wsmux` and
  `kcp` reach the same place by different roads — a smux session over TCP, over
  a websocket, or over KCP — and from there they did exactly the same thing in
  three copies that were character-for-character identical apart from the
  receiver's type and two comments. 279 lines removed, 60 left.

  The history is the argument for doing it. Every fault in that loop had to be
  found three times: the pooled connection slot that was not released when a
  connection timed out waiting to be paired, so a tunnel with `max_connections`
  lost one to every timeout until it refused everything; the mux slot that was
  not given back when announcing the backend failed, so after `MuxCon` such
  failures the session stopped taking connections at all, blocked on a counter
  only it could empty; and a connection that could not be requeued being left
  counted.

  Two tests that read the three files looking for the same fix in each were
  replaced by ones that read the single copy and additionally check that all
  three transports still delegate to it — which is the stronger statement, and
  the one that stops a fourth copy appearing.

- **The layer-3 receive batch is thirty-two datagrams, not eight.** Eight was
  set on the argument that the syscall saving flattens out by then, which the
  send path has since shown is exactly the kind of argument that turns out to be
  wrong. Measured at four widths: ~50, ~225, ~300 and ~275 kpps for 1, 8, 32 and
  128.

  Thirty-two is the peak rather than a compromise — a hundred and twenty-eight
  is no faster and sometimes slower, and would cost 900 KB more of buffers per
  tunnel. The first figure is the one worth keeping, though: a reader taking one
  datagram at a time cannot keep up at all, and the socket drops nearly half of
  them.

  The measurement also answered the question behind it, and the answer was no:
  one reading goroutine takes 500–800 kpps with four senders pushing at once and
  loses nothing — five to eight gigabits a second of tunnelled traffic — and
  neither of the ways of adding more helps. `SO_REUSEPORT` distributes by
  *flow*, and this tunnel has exactly one, so N sockets would leave N-1 idle;
  and N goroutines on one socket are serialised by the kernel and measured no
  faster than one. Both are written up in `docs/performance-notes.md` with the
  numbers.

- **`internal/manage` has a leaf underneath it: `internal/manage/spec`.** The
  transport predicates, the address and port helpers, the forwarded-port syntax
  and the control-port bind type — about 500 lines that every one of that
  package's sixty-two files uses and that use nothing themselves.

  It is the layer the split plan had missed. Measuring the package before moving
  anything showed that the three files the cycle runs through cannot be taken
  together either: forty-seven unexported identifiers cross that boundary, and
  under all three sits this vocabulary, which every attempt to move a larger
  piece was dragging along. With it underneath rather than inside, the crossings
  for those three files fall from forty-seven to sixteen.

  Nothing that calls into `manage` changed. Every name is re-declared under the
  name it had, the way `core_alias.go` already does for `manage/core`: six
  packages and the CLI call into this one, and a refactor whose diff is every
  call site is a refactor nobody can review.

  The rule that keeps the new package a leaf is written in its doc, because it
  is the only thing preventing it becoming a second dumping ground: nothing in
  it knows what a tunnel is. A function there answers a question about a string
  and never reads a file, runs a command or looks at a config.

- **`internal/menu` is one file per screen.** `menu.go` was 1,462 lines with one
  function per screen and `Run()` a long switch over all of them. It is 179 now
  — the root screen and the helpers every screen shares — and the screens live
  in `manage.go`, `proxy.go`, `backup.go`, `webpanel.go`, `system.go`,
  `telegram.go` and `update.go`, each opening with a sentence saying what that
  screen is for. Nothing else changed: same functions, same behaviour.

  One test had to move with it, and it was the right one to notice. The guard
  that every Manage option has a case in the switch read `menu.go` by name, so
  splitting the file would have left it passing while watching nothing. It reads
  the whole package now.

- **The menu package can be tested.** `tui.SetInput` replaces the source every
  prompt reads from and returns the function that puts it back — a seam, so that
  a test can be the keyboard.

  It matters because `internal/menu` is where an operator meets this product and
  it was at 3.2% coverage: a package of screens that nothing could enter without
  a person at a terminal. Eleven screens are now entered and left again, each
  asserted to print the words somebody navigates by, and the two panel
  sub-screens are drawn against a known configuration and checked in both
  directions. Two behaviours that had only been reasoned about are pinned: a
  screen handed no input at all does not spin, and a non-numeric choice is
  refused rather than rounded to something.

  21.1% by statement, with a CI floor to keep it there. No screen is driven into
  an action, and the one screen that could not be driven safely — kernel tuning,
  whose confirmation defaults to yes — is excluded with the reason written next
  to it.


- **Twelve unreachable functions, one unused field and a comment-only file are
  gone.** An export surface written for a consumer that never arrived, the two
  leftovers of the removed WireGuard-pipe mode, the bot's half of a panel
  login-code integration that no longer exists, an exported wrapper nothing
  called, a staging buffer for reads that reads never used, and a constant the
  control channel's version negotiation replaced. Two comments that described
  how things used to work were corrected rather than deleted: the reasoning
  behind that constant is recorded where the negotiation lives, and the note
  about where the pipe mode went now sits on the configuration it is about.

  `internal/testport` stays, and says why: it is an ordinary package that only
  `_test.go` files import, which reads as dead code to a tool and is not — a
  helper in a `_test.go` file belongs to one package's test binary and cannot be
  shared, and three packages need this one.

- **The stealth record layer no longer allocates for every record it sends.**
  Two allocations and a full copy of the record, up to 64 KB, once per record:
  the cipher was handed a nil destination so it allocated its output, and the
  framing then appended the header to it. On the hot path of the one transport
  whose reason for existing is to be indistinguishable from ordinary traffic, in
  a package that fights hard for exactly this elsewhere. Measured on an 8 KB
  write: four allocations per record before, one after.

- **The layer-3 receive path no longer allocates a slice per packet.** It built
  a one-element `[][]byte` at the call site for every packet that arrived. It is
  still one packet per write, and that is not an oversight: the send path
  batches because reading the interface hands back several packets from one
  syscall, and this path reads the carrier a datagram at a time, so there is
  nothing to gather without either blocking on a read that may not come or
  holding packets back on a timer. Both trade latency for syscalls on a path
  where latency is the thing being protected.

- **The engine's kernel tuning is the same table Optimize writes.** It carried
  its own copy, and the two had drifted in four places. `ip_local_port_range`
  was the one anybody noticed, because losing a service's port is visible;
  `net.core.rmem_default` (16 MB put back to 1 MB), `wmem_default` (the same)
  and `tcp_notsent_lowat` (128 KB to 32 KB) were not visible at all — an
  operator who had deliberately optimized the machine had three settings quietly
  undone by the next tunnel restart.

  There is one table now and the engine applies a named subset of it: socket
  buffers, queue lengths, and how TCP treats its own connections. What a
  starting tunnel deliberately does not touch is machine policy — the ephemeral
  port range, the congestion control algorithm, the queue discipline, IP
  forwarding. Those change how everything else on the box behaves, and
  installing a tunnel is not consent to have them changed.

- **A typo and two stale comments.** `deafultHeartbeat`; a zero-copy line
  duplicated in both engines; and `isKCP`'s doc naming four transports including
  spoof, which has been a direct-tunnel carrier rather than a reverse transport
  for some time — the function stopped covering it when it stopped being one,
  and the sentence did not.

### Fixed

- **High CPU.** Measured on every transport, idle and under load, in two
  network namespaces; five causes found and fixed:
  - **The panel, on a busy server.** Each tunnel poll ran `ss -tin` once per
    listening tunnel, from every open tab, and each dumped the TCP state of
    every socket on the machine. With 40,000 connections, five tunnels and one
    tab: **45% of a core**. The kernel now filters to the tunnels' own ports,
    once per poll for all of them, shared between tabs for 3 s: **6%**. (Quiet
    server: 5.8% → 2.5%.)
  - **xdi, client side.** Each pooled session had its own raw ICMP socket, and
    the kernel hands every one of them every ICMP packet the host receives.
    A socket filter now gives each only its own echo replies: a 256 MB transfer
    went from **54 CPU-seconds to 13**, and faster (541 → 669 Mbit/s).
  - **KCP-family tunnels on the kernel's default socket buffer.** A config
    without `so_rcvbuf`/`so_sndbuf` (the presets set them; hand-written and old
    ones may not) ran KCP, xdi, pck, QUIC and UDP on ~200 KB. Under many
    connections that overflows and the reliability layer retransmits instead
    of carrying: 16 concurrent streams over KCP did **188 Mbit/s for 21
    CPU-seconds**. They now default to 4 MB (capped by the kernel):
    **2,089 Mbit/s for 11**.
  - **Idle KCP, pck and xdi.** kcp-go spreads its per-session flush timers
    over one scheduler per CPU, so an idle tunnel woke every core: **6% of a
    core doing nothing** on a 16-core machine, against 0.15% for every TCP
    transport. One scheduler: **3%**, with the same CPU per byte under load.
    And a session that has carried nothing for three seconds now flushes
    every 200 ms instead of every 10–20, and goes back to the preset's
    interval the moment it reads or writes; while slowed it acknowledges
    every packet at once, so the first exchange after a quiet spell is not
    held back. Idle: **3% → 1.4%**.
  - **xdi, every packet.** Each echo was built and parsed through x/net's ICMP
    message types — an allocation for the message, its body and the output,
    and a second copy of the payload, in both directions. It is now written
    and read in place in a pooled buffer: a 256 MB transfer went from
    **700 to 950 Mbit/s**, and from 24 CPU-seconds to 18.

- **The panel could not use a certificate obtained any other way than its own
  Let's Encrypt run** (#49). Where Let's Encrypt could not verify the server —
  port 80 taken, or its validators unable to reach it — there was no way out: a
  certificate copied into place was overwritten by the self-signed one, which
  did not name the server's addresses. There is now a fourth option, *HTTPS, my
  own certificate*, in the panel and the CLI: two PEM paths (certbot's
  `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`), checked before they are saved, re-read on
  renewal without a restart, and — if they ever become unreadable — replaced by
  the self-signed certificate rather than a panel that will not start.
- **A tunnel whose server heartbeat was longer than the client could wait
  reconnected every half minute, with nothing in the log to say why** (#45).
  A client gives up after one and a half keepalives (at least 30 s); a server
  with `heartbeat = 60` never sends one in time. Reproduced on v1.8.1 — four
  reconnects in 150 s. The server's control heartbeat is now at most 10 s
  whatever the setting, which ends it for every client, old ones included (0
  reconnects measured). A new client talking to an old server still cannot
  tell a slow heartbeat from a dead server, so it now says which setting to
  change instead of blaming the path.
- **A server that crashed in the first half minute of a connection left the
  client waiting almost two minutes.** A client trusts the server's heartbeat
  rhythm only after three gaps, which at the ten-second beat took half a
  minute; until then it waited out its long fallback, meant for older servers
  whose beat could be forty seconds. Measured on KCP, pck, xdi and QUIC:
  **115 s** to recover from a `kill -9` a few seconds after connecting. The
  server now opens every control channel with seven quick heartbeats, doubling
  from 0.1 s up to its steady beat. A first beat that quick is something no
  older server can send — its shortest heartbeat is a second — so the client
  takes it as proof and gives up on silence after 15 s from that moment on,
  and after 30 s once the steady beat is learnt. Measured: **115 s → 17 s** on
  KCP, pck, xdi and QUIC, for a crash one second into the connection; a
  v1.8.1 server or client on the other end ran 150 s without a reconnect. Older clients only reset their deadline on a heartbeat
  and are unaffected; an older server never sends them, so a new client stays
  exactly as patient with it as before.
- **A tunnel could not be put on Turbo — it always came back as Balanced.**
  The edit form posts its whole Fine-tune section along with the preset, and
  those fields still held the old preset's numbers. The server applied them
  after the preset and, because a number had been set by hand, cleared the
  preset: the tunnel ended up with Balanced's values and no preset, which the
  form then displayed as "Balanced". Reproduced on v1.8.1. The server now
  applies only the Fine-tune fields that actually changed from what the form
  was filled with, and only those clear the preset; a switch unrelated to the
  preset (log level, MSS, zero-copy, UDP) no longer does. A tunnel with no
  preset now shows "Custom — tuned by hand" instead of "Balanced".
- **Health Check kept failing after Optimize.** Two causes:
  - Optimize wrote `/etc/sysctl.d/99-backpack.conf`, which at boot is read
    *before* `99-sysctl.conf` — the link to `/etc/sysctl.conf`, where other
    installers and panels write their own values. Theirs won after every
    reboot. The file is now `zz-backpack.conf`, applied last; the old one is
    removed the next time Optimize runs, which `update` does on its own.
  - On a container VPS (OpenVZ, LXC) the kernel refuses most `net.core.*`
    keys, and Optimize said nothing about it. It now lists every key that was
    not applied and why.
  Health Check no longer answers every miss with "run Optimize": when Optimize
  has already run it names the file that overrides the value, or says the
  kernel or the container refused it.

- **Every systemd operation failed.** When the service helpers moved into
  `internal/manage/core`, renaming the function `systemctl` to `Systemctl` also
  renamed the program it runs, and no Linux has a `Systemctl`. Starting,
  stopping, restarting, enabling and reloading tunnels — from the CLI, the
  panel, the bot and the watchdog alike — all failed with "executable file not
  found". No test ran a real command, so nothing noticed; one does now, against
  a stand-in named exactly `systemctl`. This never shipped: it came in during
  this version.

- **A crashed or rebooted server cost a kcp, xdi, pck or quic tunnel about two
  minutes; a crashed client cost kcp another two.** Measured with `kill -9` and
  with a host that vanished for twenty seconds, in two network namespaces:
  - the server now sends its control heartbeat at least every 10 seconds, and
    the client learns that rhythm and gives up after three missed beats (30 s)
    instead of a keepalive and a half (112 s). A client too old to learn it
    waits as it always did; a server too old to beat faster is not rushed;
  - a KCP server that gets a new claim while it still holds the old one — a
    client that crashed and came back — now says it is restarting to adopt it
    instead of answering as granted and dropping it in silence, which left the
    client believing it was connected for 116 seconds;
  - after all of it: 1–5 s for a crash of either side on every transport, and
    within 20 s of a rebooted host coming back.
- **A layer-3 QUIC tunnel never recovered from a dialler crash.** The listener
  accepted one connection for the life of the process; a dialler that came back
  sat in its accept queue unanswered. It now keeps every connection it accepts,
  like an unconnected UDP socket, and the tunnel's own rule — only a packet that
  authenticates moves the peer — decides which one it talks to. (Letting the
  newest connection win instead, which was tried first, would have let anyone
  who can reach the port knock an established tunnel off, no token needed.) A 5-second keepalive and 20-second idle timeout (were
  15 and 60), and a stateless-reset key derived from the token so a restarted
  listener resets the old connection at once, bring a listener crash from 69 s
  to about 23.
- **Dependencies** (Dependabot #47 and #48): quic-go 0.62.0, reedsolomon
  1.14.2, gopsutil 4.26.8, logrus 1.10.2 and the golang.org/x modules, and the
  CI actions to their current majors, with the release action still pinned by
  SHA. **Not** smux `v2.0.1+incompatible`, which #48 also proposed: that tag is
  from 2019, older than every v1.5 release, lacks `Config.Version` and
  `MaxStreamBuffer`, and would not build. Dependabot is told to leave it alone.
- The panel page asked for `/favicon.ico` at the host's root, where the panel
  answers nothing, and logged a 404 on every load.

- **A clean restart of the Iran side cost a quic, kcp, xdi or pck tunnel almost
  two minutes.** Over TCP a stopping server's socket closes and the client reads
  the FIN at once. Over UDP the goodbye was lost with the socket: quic-go ends a
  closed transport's connections without a CONNECTION_CLOSE, and kcp-go marks a
  session dead before its final flush, so the `SG_Closed` the server wrote never
  left. The client heard nothing and waited out its control deadline — 112
  seconds at the default keepalive — after a restart that took one. Measured in
  two network namespaces: 113s before, 2–4s after, on all four. The server now
  closes each QUIC connection with CONNECTION_CLOSE and gives the goodbye a
  moment to leave before the socket goes; `TestAStoppedServerIsNoticedAtOnce`
  runs at the production keepalive, which the existing recovery test did not.
- **A layer-3 dialler did not notice its listener had restarted.** The listener
  came back with no session, dropped everything sealed under the old one, and
  the dialler kept sealing into it until the routine two-minute rekey — then
  logged that as "the tunnel did not drop". Measured: 122 seconds of black hole.
  The dialler now handshakes again after 15 seconds of sending with nothing
  authentic coming back (WireGuard's rule), and says so.
- **The panel could only issue read-only API tokens.** The scope menu had no
  choices wired, so it never opened and every token came out `read`. It offers
  read, write and admin now, and the record under it refreshes after an issue or
  a revoke.
- **Two compiled test binaries (45 MB, `e2e.test` and `l3.test`) were committed**
  with the build machine's paths in them. Untracked, and `*.test` is ignored.
- **The `udp` transport's guide said TCP ports are forwarded "as usual".** They
  are not: this transport's exposed ports listen on UDP only. The guide and the
  transport page say so now.

- **The network-namespace test harnesses left everything they started running.**
  `tools/transporttest` and `tools/carriertest` each start two engine processes
  and a listener inside a namespace, and never stopped them. The namespace
  disappears when the run ends; the processes do not, because they are not in a
  PID namespace — they carry on as orphans for as long as the machine is up.

  A day of matrix runs had left **324 of them holding six and a half
  gigabytes**, and that is the smaller half of the problem. They inherit the
  script's standard output, so anything that waits for the pipe to close — a
  shell, a CI step, a task runner — waits for the orphans instead of for the
  test. A run that finished in forty seconds looked like it was still going
  eight hours later.

  Both harnesses now reap what they start, on every exit including the
  interrupt, which is the case that leaks most: somebody stopping a matrix half
  way through. `carriertest` also picked up the fix `transporttest` already had
  — a capture file per run rather than a shared `/tmp/got.bin`, which one
  leftover listener from a previous run is enough to corrupt.

  **Every performance figure in `docs/performance-notes.md` was re-taken
  afterwards**, and some of them moved: the batch-width table in particular had
  128 looking nine per cent faster than 32, which on an idle machine it is not.

- **Two allocation-budget tests were flaky, about one run in five.** Both drive
  a real socket, and when the far side falls behind, the send or receive path
  takes an error return — which allocates an `*net.OpError`, a wrapped syscall
  error, a string. That has nothing to do with whether `ReadBatch` and
  `WriteBatch` allocate per call, which is the whole question they exist to
  answer.

  They sample the figure a few times and keep the lowest. That is the right
  statistic for an allocation budget rather than a way of hiding a failure:
  allocations cannot be under-counted, so interference can only push the number
  up, and a budget the lowest sample still exceeds is a budget genuinely
  exceeded. Twelve consecutive runs, clean.

- **`docs/releasing.md` carried its verification stamp in the middle of the
  document**, with a whole section written after it — so everything below it
  looked unstamped to a reader and the test that watches those stamps was
  satisfied by a line nobody would read as covering the rest.

- **`log_format = "json"` did nothing on a layer-3 or a direct tunnel.** It was
  offered in the menus, accepted, written into the configuration file and shown
  back as set — and both engines built their logger with the text formatter
  hardcoded, so the setting had no effect at all. Only the reverse tunnel ever
  honoured it. All three do now.

  Found while giving the JSON logs something worth shipping: the new fields
  appeared on a reverse tunnel and not on the other two, which is how a setting
  that has been ignored since it was added gets noticed.

- **QUIC could not come up at all over a path with a 1280-byte MTU.** quic-go's
  first packet is 1280 bytes of payload by default, which is 1308 bytes on the
  wire over IPv4 and 1328 over IPv6. A path that cannot carry that drops every
  Initial packet, and because the Initial packet is the first thing sent, the
  handshake never completed: the transport did not connect slowly or carry a
  reduced rate, it carried nothing and reported no reason.

  1280 is not an exotic number. It is the standard MTU of an IPv6 tunnel, the
  figure a great many mobile carriers hand out, and what is left after any
  encapsulation on top of a 1500-byte link — including a BackPack layer-3 tunnel
  carrying another tunnel, which is why the `quic` carrier had it too.

  Found by running the transports over a real pair of network namespaces rather
  than loopback: at MTU 1280 the other eight reverse transports carried 2 MB
  byte-identical and `quic` carried zero bytes. Loopback has a 65536-byte MTU
  and can never show this.

  Both QUIC endpoints now start from 1232 bytes — 1280 less an IPv6 and a UDP
  header, so it fits either address family — and Path MTU Discovery, which stays
  enabled, grows it to whatever the route really carries within the first few
  round trips. A fat path loses nothing but the size of the handshake itself.
  Verified over both a 1280 and a 1400-byte namespace path, 2 MB byte-identical
  each way, and pinned by a unit test that relays QUIC through a deliberately
  narrow path.

- **A layer-3 tunnel could report packets carrying no bytes.** The two counters
  cannot be updated in one step, and the writer bumped packets first — so a
  reader landing between the two lines saw a tunnel that had carried packets
  containing nothing. Not stale: impossible.

  It mattered past looking wrong on a dashboard. `bytes_in` and `bytes_out` are
  what the watchdog's stall detection watches, and a direction that reads as
  frozen for an instant is precisely the signal it exists to act on.

  Every writer now adds bytes before packets and the reader loads packets before
  bytes — opposite orders, on purpose — which makes "packets seen implies bytes
  seen" true at every instant. A test that reads flat out while packets cross
  holds it, and it is the test that found the second half: the fix had been
  applied to the receive side only, and the send side had the same bug.

- **A reload could fight the tunnel it was replacing for its own ports.**
  `Start` returned when the transport's supervisor stopped, not when the
  goroutines it launched had — so for a window afterwards the old run still held
  its listeners, and a reload builds the next generation as soon as the previous
  `Start` returns.

  It was papered over by a flat two-second sleep in every transport's restart
  path, and the comment next to that sleep said what it was for. A sleep is a
  guess: usually long enough, never a guarantee, and silently wrong on a loaded
  machine — which is exactly when a restart is most likely to be happening.

  Every transport now counts the listeners it holds and `Start` waits for that
  count to reach zero, so "Start returned" means "the ports are free". The
  sleeps are gone, which also makes a restart faster: a listener closes in
  microseconds rather than always costing two seconds.

- **A restart that gave up left the panel and the watchdog believing there was
  a peer.** Every transport's `Restart` has a branch it takes when the tunnel is
  shutting down — rebuilding a run from a finished context would bind the ports
  the run replacing it is about to ask for — and that branch returned *before*
  the two lines that clear the status and the published peer, because those sit
  on the path that carries on.

  It was invisible for as long as the only way to reach it was a process about
  to exit and a snapshot about to go stale. The transport fallback chain makes
  it reachable: the chain cancels a candidate's context and the process *keeps
  running*, so the snapshot carries a fresh timestamp and a connected peer for a
  tunnel that is mid-rotation with nothing connected at all — and the watchdog
  reads that and calls it healthy. Fixed on all fourteen transports.


- **The engine widened the ephemeral port range back on every start.** Optimize
  sets `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` to the kernel's own `32768 60999` and
  persists it, v1.8.1 fixed it there for exactly the reason recorded in that
  release, and Health Check tells an operator whose machine is wide to go and run
  Optimize. Then the engine's start-up tuning set it straight back to
  `1024 65535` — on every tunnel, on every start.

  A server could be optimized, pass its own health check, and be wide again the
  moment anything restarted, with nothing anywhere saying so. The range is
  machine-wide, it decides whether unrelated services can keep their own ports,
  and it is persisted in a file the engine's tuning does not write; it belongs to
  Optimize and the engine no longer touches it. A machine already carrying the
  widened value is corrected by the migration above.

- **A connection limit leaked a slot on every pairing timeout, on four of the
  seven reverse transports.** Each of these reserves a slot the moment it accepts
  a forwarded connection, deliberately, so a refused connection is refused before
  it costs anything — and the handler goroutine gives the slot back when the
  transfer ends. The pairing timeout is the one path where that goroutine never
  runs: the client waited three seconds for a tunnel connection, none arrived,
  and the connection was closed without ever reaching a handler.

  `tcp` and `quic` freed the slot there. `tcpmux`, `wsmux`, `kcp` and `ws` did
  not, so a tunnel with `max_connections` set lost a slot to every timeout and
  eventually refused everything — with a limit that read correctly in the config
  and a panel showing no connections at all. The shape is identical in all six,
  which is why they are now checked together rather than one at a time.

- **Exporting a backup from the panel returned 404.** The panel is served under
  one unguessable path segment and answers nothing outside it, and every address
  it asks for carries that path — except the one it navigates to rather than
  fetches. Both Download buttons pointed at the root of the origin. The backup is
  what an operator is told to take before an update.

- **Signing out after a password change returned 404.** The same omission, twice,
  in the second half of changing the panel password. The page says every device
  is signed out including this one; what actually happened was a 404 and a
  browser still holding a live session for a password that no longer existed. The
  header's own logout link was always correct, which is why this only showed up
  here.

- **The `udp` transport counted no traffic at all.** Not a number that was
  wrong — a number that was absent. Neither counter appeared in either of its
  files, because it never hands out a `net.Conn` for the wrapper the other
  transports use to go around, and nothing had been written for the case. A udp
  tunnel carrying gigabytes read `0 B in, 0 B out` in the panel, in the CLI, in
  the Telegram report and on the traffic chart: an idle tunnel, as far as
  anything that displays it could tell.

  Proved live at the time: 200 datagram round trips carried, both counters still
  zero at both ends. The end-to-end test named "traffic is counted on every
  transport" lists six and udp is not among them — it cannot be, because that
  test forwards a TCP echo backend through the shared harness. So the one
  transport with no coverage was the one transport with no counters. It has its
  own test now, on a datagram path.

- **`max_connections` and `bandwidth_mbps` did nothing on a `udp` tunnel.** They
  were accepted by the menu, saved into the TOML, rendered, and shown in the
  panel, and the struct the transport is built from had nowhere to put them.
  Nothing anywhere said so. An operator capping a shared udp tunnel got a cap
  that read back correctly on every screen and was never applied.

  A "connection" is a source address here, because that is the only thing a
  connectionless protocol has that means the same thing: one peer's flow through
  the tunnel. The bandwidth cap is charged where the bytes are counted, for the
  same reason the traffic fix had to go there.

- **Every client transport restarted itself on a guard that was always open.**
  Each one asked `c.state.Cancel() != nil` before deciding a failure was worth
  restarting for, and that condition cannot be false: the constructor installs a
  cancel function before any of that code can run, and every restart installs
  another. So the guard was open in exactly the case it was written to close. A
  tunnel coming down — a reload, a stop, a restart already in flight — has
  several goroutines fail at once, and each one logged an error and queued
  another restart of a transport that was already going away.

  The server transports were corrected to ask their generation's own context
  some time ago, with the reasoning written down where it was fixed. The client
  ones kept the original, in all seven.

- **Client control writes had no deadline.** A write into a peer that has
  stopped reading fills the kernel's send buffer and then blocks until the
  retransmit timer gives up — around fifteen minutes on Linux defaults. The
  server grew a bounded write for precisely that failure; the client kept
  writing unbounded, on the shutdown notice, which stalls a restart for that
  whole window, and on the RTT probe, which runs on a timer forever and so
  parks a goroutine and quietly stops the figure the panel shows. Ten seconds,
  the same bound the other end uses.

- **The pairing timeout could not fire in the case it exists for.** An accepted
  client connection waits three seconds for a tunnel connection to carry it. The
  check sat at the top of the pairing loop and the loop then blocked on the
  tunnel channel — so it only ran when a tunnel connection arrived, and a
  connection that arrived is one that did not need timing out. With a pool that
  had run dry the client was held open with nobody waiting on it: the browser
  sat there until it gave up on its own, the slot it took against
  `max_connections` was never returned, and the socket stayed open for the life
  of the run. It runs on a timer now, so it fires whether or not anything
  arrives.

  The same loops left on shutdown without closing the connection they were
  holding or freeing its slot, so every reload leaked one of each per connection
  parked there.

- **A mux session that failed could deadlock its own handle loop.** Putting a
  connection back on the local queue was a blocking send, made from inside the
  goroutine that drains that very queue — and in the mux transports there is one
  such goroutine per session, so the one making the send is frequently the only
  one running. A full queue was then a goroutine waiting for itself: the tunnel
  stopped for good, with every socket still open and nothing in the log to say
  why. A connection that cannot be re-queued is closed and its slot returned,
  which is what the accept path already did with the same channel.

  The same path never gave back the mux slot it took, so a session that failed
  to send the address `mux_session` times stopped taking connections at all —
  the same stall through a different channel — and leaked the stream it could
  not use.

- **Any refresh interval above 24 hours read back as "disabled".** The schedule
  is written as a cron line, and the form written for intervals over a day was
  not one the reader matched, so `GetIntervalHours` answered 0. The job was
  installed, cron had it, and the tunnels were refreshed on it — while the menu,
  the Telegram bot and the web panel all agreed Auto Refresh was off. An
  operator who set 48 hours saw it off the next time they looked, set it again,
  and ended up with the same job written twice.

  Intervals cron cannot express are rounded, which it always did; it now says so
  rather than repeating back the number it was given.

- **The Settings rail showed values that were never true.** The markup is lifted
  from the approved design preview, so the five subtitles under it arrived as
  sample text: "1.7.6 available", "Port 8443 · Let's Encrypt", "2FA on · 2
  devices" on a panel that has no two-factor at all, and "Yesterday 03:00".
  Those are not placeholders that look like placeholders — they are specific,
  plausible claims about this machine.

  They were rewritten from real data only when there was some, and skipping the
  write is what leaves the invented line on screen, so the one moment the panel
  knew least was the moment it made the most confident claim. Every line is
  written now, and a line with nothing behind it says so. The port half of the
  Panel access line read a field the stats payload has never carried, so it was
  always undefined; it comes from the endpoint that knows the port and the
  certificate. The footer's "the two marked with a dot differ from the default"
  described a drawing — nothing on that screen marks anything with a dot.

- **The direct tunnel form never asked for its suggested values.**
  `/api/direct/defaults` answers with a subnet nothing on the machine is using,
  a free interface name and a preset. The route and the handler were both
  registered and the wrapper that calls them was never written, so the panel
  never asked. The two fields that endpoint exists for are the two an operator
  is least able to guess: a tunnel's own `/30` has to avoid every subnet already
  on the box, and picking one by hand is how you get a tunnel that comes up and
  blackholes the route it was built for.

- **The bot gave out a web panel address that does not work.** It was built as
  `http://IP:PORT`, which is two things wrong for anyone whose panel is not the
  default: a panel behind TLS refuses the plain scheme, and every panel is
  served under a secret path segment and answers nothing outside it. So the
  bot's own Web Panel screen printed an address that 404s. The CLI has printed
  the full address all along, which is why this only ever showed up here.

- **Startup validation never ran for a direct tunnel's carrier.** `pck` and
  `xdi` were reverse transports once and their checks still gated on
  `[server]`/`[client]` naming one. Both are direct-tunnel carriers now — which
  is what the setup wizard writes — so an `[l3]` config naming one went past
  every check: no Linux check, no root check, no validation of `pck_flags`,
  `pck_gateway_mac` or `pck_interface`, and not a word about iptables. The
  difference that makes is between "run as root, or grant CAP_NET_RAW with this
  command" at load, and a socket error from inside the carrier once the tunnel
  is supposed to be up. `sni` is checked with `pck`, because `sni` is `pck` with
  a ClientHello in front of it.

- **A `wss` tunnel that was not told where its certificate is now gets one.** It
  went through the file loader with two empty filenames and failed at startup
  with `open : no such file or directory` — a message with no subject, naming
  nothing. The direct engine has always generated a throwaway certificate in
  exactly this case, said so in the log, and worked, so the same configuration
  produced a working tunnel on one engine and a refusal on the other. Both use
  the same generator now.

  Generating rather than refusing is right because nothing here authenticates a
  peer with it: the token is the credential, and TLS is on the wire to look like
  TLS to whatever is in between. A certificate nobody validates serves that
  exactly as well whoever signed it. A configured certificate that cannot be
  read is still an error — an operator who supplied a path is entitled to hear
  that it is wrong.

- **The SOCKS proxy's accept loop can no longer burn a core.** A bare `continue`
  on an accept error is right for the error accept normally returns and wrong
  for the two that matter: a closed listener and a process out of file
  descriptors both return instantly and go on returning, so the loop spins as
  fast as the CPU allows with nothing to block on. The reverse transports grew a
  backoff for exactly this; the proxy runs on the same machines, against the
  same descriptor ceiling, and did not have it. It is one shared implementation
  now rather than two.

- **The last bytes of a stream are no longer dropped.** A `Read` may return what
  it has along with the error that ended the stream — `io.Reader` says so
  plainly, and says the bytes come first. The relay returned on the error and
  discarded them, so a connection whose final read carries the tail of a
  response and EOF in one call loses that tail, silently, on a path that
  otherwise carries everything faithfully. None of the readers wired to it does
  that today, which is why nobody has seen it; that is a property of those
  readers and not of the loop.

- **Installing a scheduled job can no longer delete every other job on the
  machine.** Reading the crontab answered "there is no crontab" and "the crontab
  could not be read" with the same nil, and the new crontab was built from it —
  which is a crontab containing exactly one line, ours. Any transient failure of
  `crontab -l` turned scheduling an auto-refresh into replacing the machine's
  crontab: the operator's backups, their certificate renewals, their own
  scripts, gone, with the program reporting success. The two are told apart now,
  and a read that did not happen refuses the write rather than guessing at what
  was there.

- **The `ws` transport reports its connection pool.** The pool is allowed to
  outgrow its configured size, which from outside is indistinguishable from a
  leak, so every pooled transport publishes what it has, what it is aiming for
  and what it was asked for. `ws` did not — so on a `ws` or `wss` tunnel the
  panel's pool card was not empty or zero, it was absent.

- **The panel's background probe can be stopped.** It looped on a ticker with
  nothing else to select on, so nothing short of ending the process could stop
  it. A process-lifetime singleton, so not a leak — but a panel that has shut
  its listener down went on dialling the fleet, and a test that started one left
  it running for the rest of the suite.

- **A tunnel no longer hangs a handshake waiting for Let's Encrypt.** Issuance
  happens inside a handshake, and the client talking to the CA had no timeout at
  all. A CA that is unreachable in the way that matters — a route that accepts
  the connection and then says nothing, which is the normal condition on the
  networks this runs on — left that handshake open for as long as the kernel
  kept the socket, with the peer waiting on it and the fallback certificate
  never reached, because nothing had returned an error yet. Each request to the
  CA is bounded, and so is the handshake's wait for the whole attempt; past it
  the fallback is served while issuance carries on underneath.

- **`install.sh` could not build from source.** It pinned Go 1.24.5 and accepted
  any toolchain from 1.24 up, while `go.mod` requires 1.26.0. The build runs with
  `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` on purpose — the networks this installer targets frequently
  cannot reach the toolchain downloader, and a build that silently tries to fetch
  a compiler is a build that hangs — and with that set, a Go older than the `go`
  line does not fall back to anything, it refuses.

  So building from source could not succeed on any machine, and that is the path
  taken only when downloading a release has already failed, which is to say on
  exactly the servers least able to do anything else about it. The installer
  reads the version from `go.mod` now, rather than carrying a second copy of it
  that drifts.

## v1.8.1 — 2026-09-13

Memory and descriptor fixes across the reverse transports, and the bugs found
while proving them.

The `udp` transport reserved a 100,000-datagram queue for every connection it
saw. A
Go channel allocates its whole buffer the moment it is made, so that was 2.3 MB
committed per connection before a single byte had been forwarded — and a pooled
connection may never forward one. A tunnel sitting idle with a pool of 64 held
145 MB of a 153 MB heap; two hundred short-lived flows carrying six hundred
packets between them took it past a gigabyte. The queue is 256 now, the depth
the forwarded-UDP path had already settled on for the same job. Measured on the
same tunnel: idle went from 153 MB to 4.6 MB, the 200-flow run from 1067 MB to
9 MB, and the same traffic came back through it.

Underneath that was a smaller leak no amount of waiting cleared. The first run's
channels were fields on the transport, and a restart built fresh channels for
the new run without ever replacing those fields — so the first run's queue, and
every connection still parked in it, stayed reachable for the life of the
process. It showed as 145 MB still held with no client connected and the run
torn down, released only by restarting the server.

Worth saying plainly, because the first reading of this was wrong: the flow
tables themselves were never leaking. Idle flows are reaped, the goroutines that
serve them exit, and a heap that reached 1067 MB under load came back to 151 MB
on its own. What was wrong was the size of what each connection reserved, and
one run's worth of it that was never let go.

That second fault was not unique to `udp`. The same shape — `Start` taking the
first run's channels from fields on the transport, and `Restart` building fresh
channels without ever replacing those fields — is in `tcp`, `ws` and `quic` too,
and there what it holds is sockets rather than bytes. On `tcp` the pool of idle
tunnel connections waits in that channel to be paired, so the whole idle pool is
what gets pinned: with a pool of 64, the server still held 64 open descriptors
after the client had gone and the run had been torn down, and a forced garbage
collection did not release them — an unreachable connection is closed by its
finalizer, but these were still reachable from the struct. It is a one-shot cost
rather than one that grows with every restart, and it scales with
`connection_pool`, so it is eight descriptors on the default rather than
sixty-four. After the fix the same tunnel comes back to its baseline seven on
every cycle.

`tcpmux`, `wsmux` and `kcp` carry the identical pattern and do not leak, which is
worth writing down so it is not read later as an oversight: their handle loop
takes each session off the channel the moment it arrives instead of holding it
there until a forwarded connection needs one, so there is nothing queued at
teardown to pin. They are left as they are.

### Added

- **Packet loss and round trip from the panel to every managed server.** The
  bottom of a server card repeated the login it was reached with — the user, an
  at sign and the address, all of which are already on the card or in the form
  behind it. The panel runs on the Iran side and every managed server sits at
  the far end of the route that matters, so that space now says how the route is
  behaving. Loss rather than latency alone, because latency on these paths is
  mostly distance and does not change, while loss is what a filtered or
  congested route does first and what a tunnel over it feels. The fleet is
  measured together every five seconds, in the background, so no request ever
  waits on a ping.

  A probe that gets no reply is reported as unknown rather than as total loss.
  ICMP is blocked outright on plenty of hosts and inside plenty of containers,
  and ping cannot tell that from a server dropping every packet — both come back
  as 100% loss, and printing that would put a confident, wrong figure on a card
  whose server is working perfectly.

- **The server card was redesigned around what it says.** It carried a street
  map — texture behind an address, and honest in its own note about knowing
  nothing of where the server was — on a card tall enough that a fleet of four
  did not fit on a screen, which is the one thing that page is for. The drawing
  and the pointer tilt are gone, and the identity is one line (address, place,
  version, uptime) instead of four blocks. The shell stays the tunnel card's,
  since the two are what this panel is made of and they are never on screen
  together.

  The height that saved was spent again, on purpose, by the gauge below — so the
  card ends this release taller than the one it replaced rather than shorter.
  What it is not is taller *and* carrying a drawing that measures nothing, which
  is the trade the map failed.

- **The server card's ground is a gauge.** Two rings of dots sit behind it: the
  outer one is the processor, the inner one memory, and the lit share of each
  ring is the share of that resource in use. The processor figure is repeated in
  the middle of the ring that draws it, so the card can be read across a room —
  a fleet page of mostly dark rings is a fleet with headroom, and a full bright
  one is the server that is about to become somebody's evening.

  It is a gauge rather than a ground because this card has been here before. The
  street map was removed for measuring nothing, and dots arranged on a circle
  would have been the same mistake in a new shape: the rings are spaced to a
  value or they have no business being drawn. The guard that used to assert this
  card carried no decoration now asserts that what it carries is written from a
  reading.

  The colour is reachability rather than load, because a machine nobody can
  reach has no interesting processor: the whole gauge goes to the error colour
  when the server is unreachable, and a server that has not been asked yet
  lights nothing at all rather than lighting zero.

- **A server that cannot be reached says so in red.** The status dot was the
  same grey for "unreachable" as for "not asked yet", so a server that had
  dropped off the network looked like one the page simply had not got to.
  Reachable is the ok colour, unreachable is the error one, and "checking" —
  which is the card drawn from what was written down before anyone asked — stays
  neutral, because it is claiming nothing.

- **A tunnel card says which window its chart covers, and how far the tunnel
  moved across it.** The chart was always the last twelve minutes and never said
  so. It now carries the window it is drawing — live, the past 24 hours, 7 days
  or 30 — chosen per card and remembered, with a trend figure in the header for
  how much the window moved end to end.

  The unit follows the window and has to. Live and 24 hours are rates, which is
  what the tunnel was carrying at that moment; the day windows are totals,
  because a total is what an hourly bucket adds up to, and drawing those as a
  rate would put a per-day number on an axis that means per-second. The footer's
  peak, low and average follow the same rule, so the chart and the figures under
  it can never disagree about what they are counting.

  The longer windows are read from the history the monitor already writes, and
  only when one is asked for: the dashboard polls every few seconds, and putting
  a per-tunnel history fetch on that path would be one request per tunnel per
  poll for a figure nobody had asked to see. A window whose history has not
  arrived keeps drawing the live one rather than emptying the card.

  The trend is deliberately not in the tunnel's own colour. That colour is the
  tunnel's state and nothing else — it was the direction of the traffic once,
  which meant the same green stood for "carrying more" on a tunnel that was
  down. The arrow carries the direction; the colour stays out of it.

- **The dotted ground under a tunnel's chart is back, on terms that answer why
  it went.** It was removed for competing with the line: the dots are not spaced
  to any value, so they measure nothing, and on a dark card an unmasked field of
  light dots is the brightest thing on it. It is masked from the left now, so it
  exists under the chart and has faded out before it reaches any text, and it is
  faint enough to read as ground rather than as a scale. The test that used to
  assert its absence now asserts those two conditions instead.

- **A forwarded port can name the local address it binds to, on every reverse
  transport.** `85.11.12.13:443=127.0.0.1:2053` pins that listener to one IP
  instead of to every interface, so a multi-homed server can carry the control
  channel on one public address and the exposed ports on another — including
  when both want the same port number, which bound to the wildcard is the same
  socket and fails with `address already in use`. `bind_addr` takes the same
  form for the control channel itself.

  A single port already accepted an address; what is new is that a **range** may
  carry one too, and that any of it is written down. The form was documented
  only for the direct and layer-3 tunnels, both of which describe it as
  "identical to the reverse tunnel" — a reference to a page that did not exist.
  There is one now: [Port mappings](docs/port-mappings.md), linked from the docs
  index, the CLI reference and both tunnel pages.

  Worth stating plainly, because the request that prompted this expected more of
  it: binding does **not** fix asymmetric routing on a host with two NICs. An
  accepted socket already replies from the address the request arrived on,
  whatever the listener was bound to — what breaks there is the egress route
  lookup, which is a kernel routing decision and needs `ip rule` and a per-NIC
  table regardless.

### Fixed

- **Updating now repairs the kernel tuning an older version wrote.** Nothing
  rewrites `/etc/sysctl.d/99-backpack.conf` after it is first written, so a
  value this program wrote and later regretted outlived every update — which is
  what kept `ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535` on servers tuned before the fix
  below, however many versions they installed afterwards. An update now
  re-applies the tuning, with the values this version believes in.

  Only where Optimize was run before: the file existing is the consent. A
  machine that never ran it is left exactly as it is, because installing a new
  version is not a request to have the kernel tuned. It happens before the
  services restart, so the tunnels come back up on the corrected settings rather
  than inheriting the old ones.

- **Health Check now reports a widened ephemeral port range.** Updating does not
  rewrite `/etc/sysctl.d/99-backpack.conf`, so a server set up before the fix
  below still carries `1024 65535` and has no way to know — the symptom appears
  weeks later on a service that cannot bind its own port. Health Check reads the
  live range and says so, with the one action that fixes it.

- **Optimize widened the ephemeral port range over every service port on the
  machine.** It set `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` to `1024 65535`, on the
  reasoning that more ephemeral ports means more concurrent connections. What it
  also means is that any outgoing connection can be given a port a service owns
  — and a port held that way cannot be bound by the service that owns it.

  Reported from the field as a panel node that would not start: its ports are
  62050 and 62051, which sit above the kernel's own range (`32768 60999`) and
  inside the widened one. It was intermittent, appeared weeks after install, and
  cleared when Backpack was stopped, because what held the port was one of its
  outgoing connections. Measured here: an outgoing socket given 62055 makes the
  later `listen` fail with "address already in use", and `ss -tlnp` — the
  command anyone runs to find the culprit — shows nothing at all, because the
  holder is a connection rather than a listener.

  The range is the kernel's own again. Twenty-eight thousand ephemeral ports
  with `tcp_tw_reuse` on is far more than a tunnel needs, and the four and a
  half thousand the wider range added are not worth the 61000-65535 band, which
  is where services like that one live. On top of that, the ports the configured
  tunnels listen on are now written to `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports`, so a
  tunnel port that does fall inside the range cannot be taken either.

- **The filled area under a tunnel's chart outlined itself in white.** It drew a
  line down the right of the chart, across the bottom and back up the left —
  which read as an axis, and was not one: it is the closing edge of the filled
  shape, traced because the shape was being stroked at all.

  The panel sets `svg { stroke: currentColor }` once, for its icon set, and both
  `fill` and `stroke` inherit in SVG. The line and the bars name a stroke and so
  were given the tunnel's colour; the area names only a fill, inherited the
  stroke meant for icons, and outlined itself in the card's text colour. The
  chart clears the inherited stroke now, and the two elements that are meant to
  carry one still take it.

- **One busy port took down the whole tunnel, and then the whole process.**
  Every listener in the reverse transports answered a failed bind with
  `logger.Fatalf`, which is `os.Exit(1)`. The unit these run under carries
  `Restart=always` and `RestartSec=3`, so an occupied port did not stop the
  tunnel — it put it in a three-second crash loop: bind, die, restart, bind,
  die. From the far end that reads as a tunnel connecting and dropping every few
  seconds for no stated reason.

  Measured with one forwarded port of two already taken: the control channel
  came up, the healthy port was never bound at all, the process was gone four
  seconds later, and the last line in the log was

      [FATAL] failed to listen on :62050: bind: address already in use

  A forwarded port that cannot be bound is now reported and skipped — the tunnel
  and its other ports are unaffected. The tunnel's own port is retried instead,
  backing off from two seconds to thirty, because the two things that actually
  hold it — a previous instance still shutting down, and the port in TIME_WAIT —
  both clear on their own. A port mapping that cannot be parsed is reported and
  ignored rather than ending the process, and a certificate that cannot be set
  up stops that listener with an explanation instead of the process.

  The message says which machine, which port, and what to do:

      forwarded port :62050: something else on THIS server is already listening there.
        ...
        Find out which:  ss -tlnp | grep 62050

  The direct and layer-3 forwarders already returned the error and let the
  caller decide; this brings the reverse transports to the same place.

- **A tunnel could refuse its own client for good, saying the token was in use
  by somebody else.** Reported from the field: three weeks of ordinary service,
  then every reconnection refused with "the server already has a control channel
  from somebody else" on a tunnel that had exactly one client, and no way back
  except restarting the service by hand.

  The server can hold a control channel whose peer is already gone. Nothing on
  that side reads the control channel with a deadline, and the client sends
  nothing unprompted, so there is no inbound signal to time out on; the only
  liveness check is the heartbeat write, and a one-byte write into a
  dead-but-unreset socket lands in the send buffer and reports success. The
  client does keep a read deadline, so it notices in seconds, re-dials — and was
  refused, because a control channel was still set.

  A second claim that proves the token now adopts the tunnel by rebuilding the
  run, which is what the `udp`, `kcp`, `quic`, `ws` and `wsmux` transports have
  always done; `tcp` and `tcpmux` were the two that refused instead. The token
  check moved ahead of it, so a peer that cannot present the token still gets no
  further than a refusal and cannot use this to disturb a working tunnel.

  Two clients genuinely sharing one token now take the tunnel from each other
  rather than one of them failing forever. That is the same trade the other five
  transports already make, and it is the better one: sharing a token is a
  configuration mistake somebody will notice and fix, where a tunnel that
  refuses its only client looks like the tunnel being broken.

- **A managed server's processor reading was arithmetic, not a measurement.**
  The card jumped between 0%, 100% and 50% on every poll while the machine sat
  idle. `sysstat.Get` reads the processor with a zero interval — the delta since
  the last call in the same process — which is right for the panel and the
  monitor, both of which are long-lived and call it on a timer. A managed server
  is read by `backpack node exec`, which starts, answers one question and exits:
  there is no previous call, so the only delta available is the one since the
  package initialised microseconds earlier. Over a window that short /proc/stat
  has usually not ticked, and gopsutil's own arithmetic then returns 0 when
  nothing moved and 100 when a single jiffy landed. The node path samples over a
  real 200 ms window now; nothing else changed, because everywhere else the
  instantaneous reading was already correct and is on a hot path.

- **The fleet page rebuilt every card four times a minute.** The grid already
  reconciled — a card whose content had not changed was meant to be left alone —
  and was defeated by what it compared: the signature was built from the
  server's whole `info` object and from `lastSeen`, so the processor moving by a
  percent and the timestamp moving by six seconds meant no signature ever
  matched. Every card was replaced on every poll and its entrance animation ran
  again, which is the flicker the report described as the cards constantly
  reloading. The readings are out of the signature now and written into the card
  that already exists, which is the split the tunnel cards have always made for
  their charts.

- **The fleet page stood empty until the slowest server answered.** Every card
  asks its server whether it is up, and asking means an SSH connection; four
  servers meant four or five seconds of blank page for a name, an address and a
  version that were already on disk. The first paint is served from what the
  panel already knows and contacts nothing, and the live pass follows on the
  normal poll and fills in reachability and the readings without rebuilding the
  cards. Rows drawn that way are marked pending and never claim a server is up:
  what is stored is a memory, and a green light drawn from a memory is worse
  than a grey one.

- **The Overview's daily traffic strip froze on the day it was first drawn.**
  The month of per-day totals was read once and then never again: the guard
  deciding whether to fetch tested the fetched value itself, so the first
  success stopped every later attempt for as long as the tab lived — and the
  panel is a PWA, so tabs live for days. The total above the strip kept rising
  the whole time, because that figure is recomputed from the metrics files on
  every four-second poll and never went through this path at all, which is what
  made the two disagree and sent the report looking at the sampler, the API and
  the cache, where nothing was wrong. The strip refetches every five minutes
  now, releases its in-flight guard even when a round fails, and its repaint
  signature is built from the totals so new data is actually drawn.

- **The panel reported the wrong country, city and network operator for the
  server.** The public address came solely from an echo service — ipify and the
  like — which answers a different question: where this host's *outbound*
  traffic appears to come from. That matches the server's own address on an
  ordinary VPS and parts company behind NAT, on a multi-homed box whose default
  route is not the interface users arrive on, and most sharply on a server that
  routes its own traffic through another tunnel, where the echo returns the far
  end of that tunnel. The geo lookup then ran on that address, so Location and
  ISP inherited the error — one report had its server listed in Baku, on an
  operator it has no relationship with.

  The machine's own interfaces are asked first now, and only a host holding no
  globally routable address of its own — the genuine NAT case — falls back to
  the echo. Where several public addresses are held, the one a server tunnel is
  bound to wins, since that is the address clients are told to reach. Carrier
  grade NAT (100.64.0.0/10) is excluded along with the private ranges, because
  `net.IP.IsPrivate` does not cover it and it is exactly the kind of address
  that looks public enough to be reported and is not. The common case no longer
  waits on a third-party HTTP call at all.

  The panel also says which of the two sources it used, and marks Location, ISP
  and IPv4 as inferred when they rest on the echo rather than on an address this
  machine holds — the three are one answer, and presenting a guess among them as
  a finding is what made this worth reporting rather than worth checking.

- **A port range refused to start when it named a bind address.**
  `10.0.0.5:443-450` died at startup with "invalid start port in range". Every
  transport tested for `-` before it looked for a host, so the whole string
  reached `strconv.Atoi` and failed — and each of the seven had its own copy of
  that parsing, the same forty lines seven times over, so the bug was in all of
  them and a fix had to be made in all of them. They share one helper now, which
  splits the host off before it reads the ports; the change removes about two
  hundred lines net.

  The helper is tested against real sockets rather than only against its own
  output: two listeners on one port number and two addresses have to coexist,
  which is the conflict the bind address exists to avoid.

- **A layer-3 tunnel with `paths` set came up and carried nothing.** Any value
  above one — the option spreads the udp carrier over several sockets, for a
  route that shapes per flow — produced a tunnel that completed its handshake,
  logged an established session at both ends, and moved no data at all.

  The merge layer hands one stable address upward rather than each path's own,
  so that several sockets do not read to the tunnel as a peer roaming. The
  dialling side knows that address when it is built; the listening side has
  nobody to report yet and was passing nil. The tunnel learns where its peer is
  from the address that arrives with a packet, and its outbound pump drops
  everything while that is unset — so the handshake, which replies per path,
  worked, and nothing else did. The listening side now pins the first address it
  sees and reports that.

  Every existing test for this layer drove it through an in-memory fake and none
  asked what it reports when built without an address, which is how it shipped.
  There is a test for exactly that now.

- **The `udp` transport reserved 2.3 MB for every connection it saw.** The
  payload queue was 100,000 datagrams deep, allocated in full the moment a
  connection appeared, whether or not it ever carried traffic. It is 256 now —
  deep enough to hold a session's opening packets while the flow waits to be
  paired, which is what dropping there would cost, and bounded so a peer that
  floods a stalled flow cannot grow the process without limit.

- **A restart never released the first run's queue — on `udp`, `tcp`, `ws` and
  `quic`.** `Start` took its channels from fields on the transport that
  `Restart` did not replace. It builds its own generation now on all four,
  exactly as `Restart` already did, and those channels and the usage monitor are
  gone from the transport structs, so nothing outlives the run that made it. On
  `udp` this was 145 MB still held with no client connected; on `tcp`, 64 open
  sockets that only a server restart freed.

- **A tunnel connection that failed a single write was lost rather than
  replaced.** The error path left the connection's mutex locked for good — the
  keepalive takes it with `TryLock`, so that connection could never be pinged
  again — and left it in the active table with its queue never closed. It is
  unlocked and dropped whole now, so the next one is tried.

- **Cleanup could remove a newer flow recorded under the same address.** Both
  teardown paths deleted by key without checking the entry was still theirs. A
  peer that came back under an address that had just been reused had its new
  flow deleted from the table while nothing closed it, so every later datagram
  from it was filed against a queue no goroutine reads — the same stale-entry
  failure the timeout path is careful to avoid. Both paths check identity now.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-09-09

> Tagged v1.7.7.5 and v1.7.8 while it was being tested; this is the release.


Managed servers are reached over SSH now, and the panel that drives them is the
only panel. Those are the same change told twice. The old node model was an
agent Backpack installed on the far server, listening on a port of its own,
speaking a protocol of its own — and it was the reason adding a server took
minutes, reported three tunnels where there was one, and built tunnels that did
not carry traffic. What it was really doing was reimplementing, badly, something
every one of these servers already runs. So it is gone: a server is added with
an address, a port, a username and a password, and Backpack logs in the way you
would. There is no agent, no port to open, and nothing to install before the
first connection.

The rebuilt panel replaces the classic one rather than sitting beside it. It was
served at /panel/ behind a per-server setting for as long as it was unfinished,
with an escape hatch back to the single-file dashboard; that scaffolding, and
the 350 KB dashboard it protected, are both removed. The panel answers at "/".

The rest is what a week of using it turned up. Every figure the overview showed
was formatted before it was totalled, so the totals were wrong in a way no
screenshot could reveal. The open-file-limit health check measured the wrong
process and advised a fix that could not work. The speed test blamed the far
server for a connection this one refused. A layer-3 tunnel whose far side had
nothing listening on the mapped port said nothing at all about it. None of these
announce themselves; each was found by running the thing and reading what it
claimed against what was true.

### Changed

- **Managed servers speak SSH.** Adding one asks for the four things an SSH
  login needs — address, port (22 unless yours differs), username (usually
  root) and password — and the host key is trusted on first use and pinned
  after. Backpack installs itself on the far server over that connection,
  reports its version, system and uptime on the server card, and upgrades it
  from the panel with one click when a release lands. **The node agent, its
  listening port and its wire protocol are removed**; a server enrolled the old
  way must be added again.

- **The panel is served at "/".** /panel/ redirects there, so a bookmark, a
  pinned tab or a link somebody was sent keeps working. The Interface setting
  that chose between the two panels, the /api/panelui endpoint behind it and the
  ?panel=classic escape hatch are gone with the panel they switched to.

- **Reverse tunnels are built through managed servers only.** The panel used to
  offer "I will set the other one up myself" and a setup link to paste on the
  far server; both are removed. A tunnel to a server that is not in the fleet is
  made from the CLI menu, and the panel shows its card like any other.

- **IP spoofing and SNI spoofing are CLI-only.** They stay available from the
  menu and stay fully supported; what they no longer have is a place in the
  panel's Add tunnel, where they were the two carriers most likely to be picked
  without understanding what they do to a route.

### Fixed

- **The CLI would not compile for any 32-bit target.** The GRE key prompt
  compared against 2^32-1 as an `int`, which overflows on 386 and every 32-bit
  ARM, so the whole package was a build error there. Found by building the
  architectures above for the first time.

- **The release workflow published two archives however many were built.** It
  listed them by name, so an architecture added to the build would be produced
  and then left on the runner — no failure, just an asset the release page never
  carried and an update that 404s on those machines.

- **A refusal that has one remedy now offers it.** Both measurements a tunnel
  can have — the link test and the speed test — need the server holding its
  other end, and both refuse when the panel does not know which server that is.
  The refusal said to go and link it; the action was two screens away, and
  knowing it exists at all was the hard part. The message carries the button
  now. The server names the remedy in a header rather than in the sentence, so
  rewording the prose cannot quietly take the button away.

- **A KCP tunnel's startup notes were printed once per pooled session.** They
  describe the run, not the connection, but they were emitted from the dial —
  and a KCP client dials a whole pool. So every reconnect printed the parameters
  and the FEC advice fifteen times in the same second, on a tunnel that was
  already in trouble, burying the one line that said why it had reconnected.
  Once per run now, and again if a setting genuinely changes.

- **"No heartbeat within the keepalive period" said less than it knew.** It
  reads as one missed beat. The window is one and a half keepalives and the
  server sends on a shorter timer, so reaching it means several in a row were
  lost — a path dropping packets, not a slow server. It says so, with the
  figure, and points at FEC first on a tunnel that has it.

- **The panel's Logs never opened.** Every Logs button answered "404 page not
  found", on both ends of every tunnel, and the viewer sat on "Reading" for a
  request that had already failed — which is also why logs looked stale, why
  switching to another server showed nothing, and why what had been on screen
  disappeared. One cause: the logs call built its own URL and asked for it at
  the root of the origin, which is the one address the panel does not answer.

- **"too many segments" was explained wrongly, and confidently.** The log
  explainer matched the phrase and nothing else, so it told an operator on
  1.7.7.5 to "update to 1.7.5 or later" — install something older than what they
  were running — and reported a failing layer-3 read on a TCP reverse tunnel,
  which has no layer-3 read. An explanation now has to say what must be true of
  the tunnel and the version before it is offered, and when nothing fits, the
  panel says nothing.

- **The Add form did not send the preset it was showing.** One button carries
  `on` in the markup, so the form opens with Balance visibly chosen — but the
  choice was only recorded when somebody pressed one. Accepting what was on
  screen wrote a tunnel with no preset at all, and the edit dialog then read an
  empty value and fell back to whichever option the preview was drawn with. The
  two screens disagreed about a tunnel and neither was wrong: nothing had been
  recorded either way.

- **Close did nothing on Alerts, Health check and Speed test.** The preview
  called its close function `cl`, the binding only recognised names beginning
  "close", and so the cross in the header worked while the button actually
  labelled Close did not.

- **The Servers page threw "behind is not defined" on Refresh.** A call left
  behind when the banner it painted was removed.

- **Country and location were blank on every tunnel card.** They came from a
  lookup against providers an Iran server cannot reach, so it returned nothing
  and the card showed a dot where a flag belongs and a dash where a location
  belongs. A managed server is outside that route by definition and answers for
  itself now; failing that, the card shows the address rather than a dash.

- **A server card showed what a machine is, never what it is doing.** What it
  reported was written down when it was added and rewritten only on an upgrade
  or a manual refresh, so version and uptime were frozen at that moment. The
  fleet page asks again when what it holds is more than a few seconds old.

- **The metrics screen ran its headline figures to the edge.** Carrying now,
  Peak in the day and Up last 24 hours sat directly in the dialog body with no
  gutter, while every heading, chart and table around them was inset.

### Added

- **Five more architectures: 386, s390x, and ARM v5, v6 and v7.** The releases
  carried amd64 and arm64 only. The three 32-bit ARM variants are built and
  named apart because they are not interchangeable — a v7 binary on a v5 board
  is an illegal instruction, not a slow one — and each build is stamped with the
  variant it was compiled for, because `runtime.GOARCH` says "arm" for all
  three and a binary that could not tell them apart would ask for an asset no
  release publishes. `install.sh` reads the variant from `uname -m`, falling
  back to `/proc/cpuinfo` and then to v6, which runs on v6 and v7 both.

- **Real-time processor and memory on each server card.** Read on that machine
  when the panel asks — nothing here can see another server's processor — and
  coloured at 75% and 90%.

- **The link test runs on the server that can take it.** It measures the path a
  tunnel dials out over, and only the dialling end has one; an Iran panel holds
  the listening half of every reverse tunnel, so it refused — while holding a
  root shell on the machine that could have answered. When the tunnel is linked
  to a managed server, the panel asks that server and labels the reading with
  where it was taken.

- **Editing a server happens inside its own card.** It used to insert a separate
  form after the card, and another one on every press of Edit, so a server could
  end up with several open forms disagreeing about its address. It is one panel
  per server, on the same surface as the remove confirmation beside it.

- **Every traffic figure on the overview was computed from a formatted string.**
  "1.2 TB" parsed back as 1.2, so totals across tunnels were arithmetic on
  numbers that had lost their units — the all-time traffic, the per-tunnel
  shares and the split between directions were all wrong together, and
  consistently wrong, which is why they looked right. The API sends the raw byte
  counts beside the formatted ones now, and the panel computes with those.

- **The open-file-limit health check measured the panel, not the tunnels.** It
  read the limit of whichever process happened to answer, reported 1024, and
  told the operator to run Optimize and reboot — which changed nothing, because
  the tunnel services carried no LimitNOFILE at all. It reads the limit of the
  tunnel's own process now, and the unit files set one.

- **The speed test blamed the far server for a local refusal.** A connection
  this machine refused was reported as the other end needing its receiver turned
  on, sending operators to a server that was working. A locally refused
  connection is now named as one.

- **A layer-3 tunnel whose far side has nothing listening now says so.** Every
  signal an operator can see said the tunnel was healthy — a session on both
  ends, a completed MTU probe, clean pings, rekeys on schedule — and all of it
  was true; the service behind the forwarded port simply was not there. That
  failure was logged at debug, so the log was silent about the one thing that
  was wrong. It is a warning now, repeated at most once a minute, and the
  recovery is reported too.

- **A pck listener could not start without a default route.** The listening side
  has no peer to route toward, so it probed 1.1.1.1 to find its egress
  interface, and a machine using policy routing, an IPv6-only default or a
  private segment failed with an error naming an address the operator had never
  configured. The listener falls back to the first usable interface; the dialling
  side, which does have a real peer to reach, is unchanged.

- **Enrolling a server could no longer half-finish.** A shutdown or a dropped
  network during enrolment could leave the far server holding credentials this
  one had discarded, unreachable from either side. Enrolment is claimed,
  acknowledged and given a grace period, and a shutdown waits for it rather than
  cutting it short.

- **A tunnel could be held down by a peer that stopped reading, until somebody
  restarted it by hand.** The server writes one byte at a time on its control
  channel — a heartbeat, a request for a pool connection — and those writes had
  no bound. A write lands in the kernel's send buffer and returns; when the path
  to the client goes and the buffer fills, it blocks until the kernel stops
  retransmitting, which is around fifteen minutes on Linux defaults. For that
  whole window the server still believed it had a control channel, so it refused
  every attempt by the client to establish a new one ("a control channel is
  already established"), could not ask for pool connections because the request
  reached nobody, and dropped every user connection with the queue full —
  thousands of lines a second. Nothing it could do would recover it. Control
  writes are bounded at ten seconds now, on all seven transports: past that the
  channel is treated as gone, the transport restarts, and the client's next
  claim is accepted.

- **"the queue is full, dropping a client from ..." named the wrong machine.**
  It printed the local address of the accepted connection, so every one of those
  lines carried the server's own address and the forwarded port — which reads as
  the server connecting to itself, and sends anyone debugging it in the opposite
  direction from the problem. It names the client now.

- **A failed control write reported itself as a read.** "failed to read message
  from net.Conn: write tcp ...: write: connection timed out" was the wire
  helper's error text on the write path.

- **The "Random" button no longer offered a random forwarded port.** It sat
  beside Forwarded ports as well as Tunnel port, and asks the server for a port
  that is free *on this machine* — right for the port this side binds, and the
  opposite of right for a forwarded one, which the field's own hint says goes to
  the same port on the kharej machine. A port chosen for being free here is by
  construction one nothing is listening on there, so the button could only build
  a tunnel that comes up, reports a peer, shows green and refuses every
  connection at the last hop. It is offered for the tunnel port alone, and bound
  to that field rather than to every button carrying the label.

- **A tunnel delivering into nothing no longer reads as healthy.** When the
  service on the far machine is not listening, every connection crosses a
  working tunnel and dies one hop past the end of it — and every reading the
  panel had said so: control channel up, peer connected, counters moving, all
  true. The client records the failing last hop in its metrics snapshot now
  instead of only logging it, the far end reports it to the panel over the same
  SSH connection the fleet already uses, and the card says which address is not
  answering and how many connections have been lost since. The state stays
  "online", because the tunnel is: restarting it would fix nothing, and the
  watchdog reads that field.

- **A server already running an older Backpack is upgraded, not refused.**
  Adding one reached it, found a Backpack that did not understand the panel's
  command, and reported it as a server that could not be reached — printing the
  far machine's own help into the add form, which told the operator to run
  `backpack node setup`, the flow this release removes. Every server in an
  existing fleet is in that state the day the panel is upgraded, so this was the
  ordinary path rather than an edge. A binary that is too old is now recognised
  as one to install over, the same as one that is missing, and the install is
  what upgrades it. The panel no longer repeats whatever the far machine
  printed.

- **Creating a tunnel with an unknown preset is refused by name.** It used to be
  accepted and silently ignored, so the tunnel was built on defaults nobody
  chose.

- **Closing a dialog returns to the screen it was opened from.** Every dialog
  drew the tunnels list underneath it, so closing one opened from the overview
  left you somewhere you had not been.

### Added

- **Every redirect the panel sends lands inside the panel.** Handlers below the
  base-path wrapper see the path with the prefix already removed, so a Location
  built from one — `/login`, `/` — pointed at the root of the origin, which is
  now the one place the panel does not answer. Opening the panel bounced to a
  404 and there was no way in at all. Signing in, signing out and the old
  `/panel/` address all carry the prefix now.

- **A four-part version is compared on all four parts.** Versions were read as
  three numbers, so `1.7.7.5` parsed as `[1 7 7]` — the fourth component fell
  inside the last split and was dropped — and was therefore indistinguishable
  from `1.7.7`. Nothing could see a point release as an update: not the CLI's
  check, not the panel's banner, and not the **Upgrade to** button on a managed
  server's card, because all three ask the same function.

- **Update from a file you downloaded yourself.** The download is the step most
  likely to fail on the networks this project exists for — the mirrors help and
  do not always work. **Update → Install from a downloaded file** takes the
  release archive from `/root` instead: fetch
  `backpack_linux_<arch>.tar.gz` from the releases page on any machine that can
  reach GitHub, `scp` it over, and choose it. The menu line says what it found,
  including the version, which is read by running the binary inside the archive
  rather than guessed from the filename.

  Everything after the download is the ordinary update and not a special case:
  verified against `SHA256SUMS` when one is beside it, a restore point taken
  first, every service restarted and health-checked, and rolled back on its own
  if a tunnel does not come back. The archive is deleted once the new version is
  running and healthy — and left alone when it is not, because it is the thing
  you would retry from.

- **A tunnel that already exists can be linked to the server holding its other
  end.** Everything the fleet does for a tunnel — carrying an edit across,
  starting and stopping both halves together, reading the far server's journal,
  standing the speed test's receiver up over there — is gated on a record of
  where that other half lives, and that record could only ever be written at the
  moment the panel built both ends at once. So a tunnel made any other way, or
  made before its server joined the fleet, was permanently outside it: **this is
  why the speed test still did nothing on an existing tunnel after its server
  was added.** The tunnel's own menu links it now, and unlinks it again.

  The match is demonstrated rather than guessed. A reverse client dials its
  server's host and port, and that port is the one the server binds — so a
  tunnel on the far machine aimed at this one, on this tunnel's port, is this
  tunnel's other end whatever either of them is called. Those are marked; the
  rest are offered unmarked and never claimed. Nothing is linked without the
  operator saying so, because a pairing decides where their next edit is sent.

- **A server joining the fleet says which tunnels it already holds the far end
  of.** The same matching, run once when the server is added, asked one tunnel
  at a time. It offers and never links.

- **Deleting a tunnel can now remove the far end too, as its own question.** It
  never crossed before, on the reasoning that a delete here is not consent to
  one there — which is right, and unchanged. What changed is that the panel asks
  the second question instead of leaving the operator to go and do it by hand:
  a separate dialog, after this end is settled, naming the other machine, with
  the safe answer under the cursor and under Enter. Saying nothing still leaves
  the far end alone.

### Security

- **The panel is served under an unguessable path, and answers nowhere else.**
  A panel on a known port at `/` is found by the sweeps within hours of being
  started and answers login attempts from strangers from then on. It now lives
  under a random 14-character segment — `http://your-ip:7777/x7Kq2p9wRt4mNs/` —
  and every other address on that port, `/` and `/login` included, is a plain
  404 that says nothing about a panel being there.

  This is not authentication and does not replace the password. It changes who
  ever reaches the prompt.

  **The address moves on upgrade**, for existing installs as well as new ones,
  so a bookmark will stop working. The new one is printed by the CLI's **Web
  Panel** screen, shown on the panel's own Panel access settings, and written to
  the journal when the panel starts.

  **Web Panel → Panel path** shows the address and moves it: a new random one
  (for the day the old one ends up in a chat or a screenshot), one you choose,
  or back to the root for anyone who wants the panel found by a port scan.

- **A managed server could put script into the panel.** The panel lists a
  server's tunnels by reading that server's config directory, and those names
  are filenames — on Linux anything but `/` and NUL is legal in one. The name
  went into a confirmation dialog that assigned it to `innerHTML`, and the
  panel's own policy allowed inline script, so `<img src=x onerror=…>` as a
  filename on a fleet member ran in the operator's session, on the origin that
  holds every other server's root password. The Add-a-server flow rendered it
  with no click at all. Three things stop it now, each holding on its own: the
  name is refused on arrival if it is one the panel would not create itself,
  it is not stored if it somehow arrives, and the dialog escapes whatever it is
  given. Found by a review of this release; reproduced in a browser before and
  after.

- **The panel's Content-Security-Policy no longer allows inline script.**
  `script-src` carried `'unsafe-inline'`, which is what made an injected
  attribute executable — the policy permitted exactly what it exists to stop. It
  names a per-response nonce instead. The panel's view templates carry inline
  `onclick` from the preview they were drawn as, and none of it ever reaches the
  document; the two pages that do ship an inline script are handed the nonce.

- **golang.org/x/crypto updated to v0.56.0**, which closes the SSH
  source-address advisory reported against v0.54.0 and a second client-side one
  fixed in the same series. golang.org/x/net and golang.org/x/text move with it.

### Removed

- **Remote access, two-factor authentication and new-sign-in notifications**,
  from the settings screen and from the code behind them. None of the three did
  anything useful in their current state.

- **The on/off switch on managed servers**, which guarded a listener that no
  longer exists — the panel dials out, so with no servers in the fleet it does
  nothing at all, and turning "nothing at all" off could only ever be in the way.

- **The classic dashboard** (internal/webui/assets/dashboard.html) and the 57
  tests that pinned its markup. What those guarded about the rebuilt panel — the
  setup and edit forms matching the structures they post into, field by field in
  both directions — is guarded there instead.

## v1.7.6 — 2026-09-03

IP spoofing was a reverse transport that could not work, and this release makes
it a direct-tunnel carrier that does. A reverse tunnel is a control channel plus
a pool of connections, each its own session, and a forged-source packet carries
nothing a receiver can tell those sessions apart by — every one of them arrives
at the same address, the session layer keys on that address, and each new
session closed the one before it. The tunnel reported itself connected and
carried nothing. The direct tunnel has one session, which is the shape the
carrier can actually serve. The same fault, from the same cause, is fixed in
xDi. And the carrier picked up the two things it was missing against the tool it
was modelled on: error correction, and several sockets. Everything below was
proven end to end — a real tunnel over real sockets moving real traffic — not
just unit tested.

The direct tunnel also gained three carriers and lost a choice. QUIC carries the
tunnel in real QUIC datagrams, so a path sees HTTP/3; ICMP is offered again; and
SNI spoofing sends a TLS hello naming a domain the route allows, so a box that
classifies by server name lets the rest through. The encapsulation is GRE and
only GRE — two of them were a way for the ends to disagree, and a pair that did
came up, reported a peer, logged nothing and carried nothing.

And the new panel stopped being a drawing. It was built from a preview, and a
preview draws controls rather than making them work: this release fixes
thirty-six faults found by clicking every control on every screen against a real
server — a running tunnel shown as stopped, an edit that could not be saved, a
certificate section that refused every mode, invented figures presented as
readings. Its second source of data is gone with them, because somewhere for
made-up numbers to come from is what let so many of them survive.

### Changed

- **IP spoofing is a direct-tunnel carrier now, not a reverse transport.**
  `transport = "spoof"` is refused at startup, by name, with what to build
  instead: a direct tunnel on the spoof carrier, which forwards the same ports
  over the same forged packets. The wizard offers it under **Direct**, and the
  panel builds and edits it in full. **This is a breaking change** for anyone
  running a reverse spoof tunnel — which could not have been carrying traffic,
  for the reason above — so rebuild it as a direct one. Relay mode
  (`spoof_mode`, `spoof_pipe`) went with the reverse transport: a direct tunnel
  is a private network, so WireGuard and the like are routed over it rather than
  piped through it.

- **xDi tells its sessions apart by the ICMP identifier.** It had the same
  collapse as reverse spoof — every session of a tunnel identical on the wire,
  so the listener folded them onto one entry and closed each as the next
  arrived. The identifier the protocol has for exactly this was being derived
  from the token, so it was the same for every session; it is drawn per session
  now. **A breaking wire change for xDi** — both ends must run this version — but
  since the transport could not carry traffic before, there is nothing to lose.

### Added

- **QUIC as a direct carrier.** A real QUIC session — real TLS 1.3, ALPN `h3` —
  carrying the tunnel in RFC 9221 datagrams. It is the only obfuscated carrier
  that needs no root, and it is not imitating HTTP/3: it is HTTP/3's transport.
  Datagrams rather than a stream, because a layer-3 tunnel carries IP packets
  whose flows already handle their own loss, and stacking retransmission on that
  makes throughput collapse instead of degrade.
- **SNI spoofing as a direct carrier.** The pck carrier plus one extra segment at
  the start of the flow: a TLS ClientHello naming a domain the path allows. A
  filter that decides by server name reads it and stops looking. The technique is
  patterniha's, by way of therealaleph/sni-spoofing-rust. It wraps the pck
  carrier rather than changing it, and the far end drops the hello before the
  tunnel sees it — so nothing has to be smuggled past a stranger's stack.
- **ICMP (`xdi`) is offered again.** It was built, tested and still running; it
  had simply been taken out of the menus.
- **The updater can be pointed at a tunnel.** It already tried a relay after a
  direct connection, but only one that already carried the relay port — which on
  an Iran server with working tunnels and no route to GitHub meant no relay at
  all. The CLI now names the tunnels that are up, says which would cost a restart,
  and fetches through the one chosen.
- **A way out of two-factor from the CLI.** It is set from the panel and the code
  is delivered by the bot; when that delivery stops working the panel refuses
  every sign-in, and the setting that would fix it was behind that sign-in. Web
  Panel → Two-factor sign-in is the way back.
- **The watchdog says whether a tunnel came back.** It restarts one that has
  stopped carrying traffic and said so only into a file the bot read when asked.
  The half of the story an operator waits for now arrives.
- **A one-click switch between the panels, in both of them.** The classic panel's
  was a checkbox two clicks deep in Settings; the new one's was a menu item. Both
  are menu items now.

- **Managed servers.** A foreign server can register itself with a panel and be
  configured from it, so a tunnel is set up in one place instead of twice. On
  the panel: **Servers** → turn the listener on, name the server, copy the line
  it produces. That line **installs Backpack and enrols the server in one go** —
  `bash <(curl -fsSL .../install.sh) node --panel <ip>:<port> --key <key>` — so
  a bare VPS is one paste rather than two steps in an order that has to be got
  right. The installer validates the arguments before it downloads anything, and
  a server that already has Backpack can use the short `backpack node setup …`
  form the panel keeps one click away. After that **Add
  tunnel** offers it under *The other server*, and Create builds both ends —
  every transport and carrier, reverse or direct. Editing sends the complete
  state the tunnel should be in, so a changed MTU or transport rewrites the
  config on the far server too, with the same write-restart-and-roll-back
  protection a local edit has always had. An edit that cannot reach the server
  is reported as exactly that — this end changed, that one did not, and which
  one is behind — rather than as plain success. Deleting a tunnel removes it
  here only; the panel names the server that still has it. The CLI menu warns
  before editing a paired tunnel, because that process has no channel to the
  node and the change would not travel.

  The panel is **never given a login** for the machine. The command installs a
  local service that holds the privilege; what crosses the wire is a request to
  perform one of four operations — apply, list, status, restart — and the node
  refuses anything else. There is deliberately no operation that runs a command,
  reads a file, or removes a tunnel. The server dials the panel rather than the
  reverse, so it opens no inbound port of its own, and the channel is a Noise
  `NNpsk0` session with no fingerprint to match on. Setup keys are single-use
  and expire in a day; each server's own credential is issued at enrolment and
  revoked by **Remove**, which leaves its tunnels running. The channel is
  independent of the tunnels, so a tunnel that is down does not take away the
  way to fix it. A speed test on a tunnel whose far end is managed now starts
  the receiver there itself — it was the last step that still needed somebody
  on the other machine — and that sink closes itself when the run is over. A tunnel's
  card drives both ends too: start, stop and restart reach the managed server,
  because a tunnel in two places has one state and an end stopped on its own
  just leaves the other half dialling. Delete stays local by design. **New panel only.** See
  [docs/managed-servers.md](docs/managed-servers.md).


- **Error correction on the direct tunnel.** For every `fec_data` datagrams the
  tunnel sends `fec_parity` spare ones, and any `fec_parity` of a group may be
  lost without loss — redundancy, never retransmission, which is the only thing
  a layer-3 tunnel may safely stack. Measured against a link dropping 20%, an
  application saw **3.5% loss with it on and 39% with it off**. It works over
  every carrier, both ends must set the same pair, and it is one question in the
  wizard and a checkbox in the panel.

- **Several sockets for the UDP carrier (`paths`).** A tunnel on one socket is
  one flow, and a provider that limits each flow separately gives it one flow's
  allowance however fast the link is. Spreading over several sockets — on
  consecutive ports from the tunnel port — makes it several flows. Measured
  against a link capped at 8 Mbit/s per flow, one socket carried **5.8 Mbit/s
  and four carried 23.6**. It is the UDP carrier only; the obfuscated carriers
  vary their source per packet already.

- **Two more spoof packet profiles, `proto58` and the rest, in the menus.**
  `icmpv6`, `ipip` and `gre` existed in the engine but only a hand-edited config
  could reach them; `proto58` — an ICMPv6 echo's protocol number carried bare,
  which some filters leave open when they clamp ICMP and UDP — is new. All seven
  are now offered by the CLI wizard and the panel, from one shared list.

- **The panel configures the spoof carrier in full.** It could create a spoof
  tunnel and set one thing about it — the peer address — while the CLI asked
  six questions. The direct form and the edit screen now carry the packet
  profile, the forged sources, Stealth, error correction and the socket count,
  each shown only for the carrier that has it.

- **Reverse-path filtering is checked and offered.** A strict `rp_filter` drops
  every forged-source packet before the tunnel sees it — the most common reason
  a spoof tunnel is up, connected, and silent. Health Check now reports it per
  tunnel with the exact `sysctl` to fix it, the startup check reads the
  *effective* value (the max of `conf.all` and the receiving interface, which is
  what the kernel applies — reading only `conf.all` missed a strict interface),
  and the wizard offers to relax it after a spoof setup.

### Fixed

- **A running tunnel was shown as stopped, everywhere in the new panel.** The
  server reports `online`, `offline` or `stopped`; six screens compared against
  `running`, which nothing produces. The card said Stopped, the overview counted
  it among the ones that were not running, and neither the speed test nor the
  link test would offer it.
- **Nothing on the edit screen could be saved.** Its Save button shipped disabled
  and nothing ever enabled it; once enabled, every save was refused because the
  form posted fields the transport does not have, and the tunnel port as a number
  where the server wants a string.
- **The panel could not be put behind a certificate of any kind.** The three
  options were drawn but were not controls, and Apply posted no mode at all, so
  every attempt came back "unknown mode" — Let's Encrypt included.
- **A failed Let's Encrypt issuance took the panel down with it.** autocert fails
  the handshake when it has no certificate, so a domain that does not resolve
  yet, a blocked port 80 or a rejected contact address locked the operator out of
  the page they would have fixed it from. The self-signed certificate is served
  meanwhile, and the panel switches over on its own once issuance succeeds.
- **A tunnel's certificate could only be set from the CLI.** The panel now reads
  and sets it, on the transports that present one.
- **Invented figures shown as readings.** Signed-in devices that belonged to
  whoever drew the screen, a bot named `@my_backpack_bot`, a backup taken
  "yesterday at 03:00", a week's traffic on a tunnel that had carried none, and
  every dialog headed with another machine's hostname and version.
- **`?mock=1` drew an empty server over a busy one.** The panel's fixtures were
  never shipped inside the binary, so forcing that mode fetched files that were
  not there. There is one source of data now.
- **One click sent as many requests as the screen had been visited.** Delegated
  handlers accumulated on a container that outlives the view, so the fifth visit
  meant five restarts from one press.
- **Ports, sizes and states rendered as nonsense.** Forwarded ports crashed the
  whole tunnels page, memory and disk read `NaN / NaN GB`, and a configured swap
  reported itself as not configured.
- **A direct tunnel with the spoof carrier could never have its far end built.**
  The producer's real address is what the listening side cannot learn for itself,
  and it was carried only when some spoof tuning had also been set — so the
  ordinary case, accepting the defaults, built one end and could never build the
  other.
- **Four lists of direct carriers.** The CLI's, the panel's, the create path's
  and the wizard's markup drifted, so a carrier added to some was offered by a
  screen whose endpoint then refused it by name. There is one list, checked
  against the engine that has to open them.
- **The updater's `already up to date` read as a contradiction** when the build
  was newer than the last published release.
- **Shutting the node hub down did not wait for it.** Closing the listeners and
  the sessions unblocks its goroutines, but one already past its read keeps
  running — mid-handshake, or writing the fleet to disk. A caller that then took
  away what those goroutines were using raced them.
- **Test ports collided between packages on CI.** The sequence started from the
  clock in milliseconds, and `go test ./...` starts a binary per package, several
  within the same millisecond.

- **The setup link was only offered on reverse tunnels.** The box that takes a
  link from the other server sat inside the reverse half of the setup form, so
  on a direct tunnel — which is what the wizard builds — it was never on screen,
  and the paired values had to be retyped after all. It now sits above the
  split, where it applies to both. The decoder always handled either kind; only
  the box was unreachable. *(New panel.)*


- **The icmp spoof profile silenced ICMP on the tunnel itself.** To stop the
  kernel answering the forged echo requests — a wasted reply per data packet, on
  the download path — the carrier set `net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all`, which is
  per-namespace and also silenced ICMP arriving on the tunnel. A layer-3 tunnel
  is a private network people ping across, so this broke a first-class use: ping
  across an icmp-profile tunnel was 100% loss while TCP was fine. It is a
  targeted iptables rule now, matched on the carrier's ICMP identifier, so the
  kernel's replies are dropped and the tunnel's own ICMP is untouched.

- **The XDP fast path declined without a word.** `spoof_xdp_interface` computed
  whether the kernel program attached or fell back and then threw the answer
  away — a loose end from the carrier's own refactor — so an operator who turned
  it on had no way to learn which happened. The tunnel now logs
  `XDP receive fast path attached to …` or `XDP receive unavailable … <reason>`
  on start.

## v1.7.5 — 2026-08-28

Every fix in this release came from somebody's tunnel, and almost all of them
turned out to be the same shape: the tunnel was broken and the system said it
was fine. A control channel that had been dead for eleven minutes and had not
noticed. A layer-3 tunnel writing segments past the end of the buffers it was
given, because the buffers were sized for a packet the kernel had stopped
sending. A watchdog reading health off a socket table that keeps saying
ESTABLISHED after the far end is gone. A second tunnel that started cleanly and
was refused on every handshake with no reason given, forever. A spoof carrier
whose sockets were healthy while nothing it sent survived the path. So a good
deal of the work below is not new behaviour but the system telling the truth
about itself sooner. Every fix has a regression test that fails without it.

### Added

- **Speed Test on the tunnel card.** The measurement existed, in the menu, over
  SSH. Now it is a button next to Start/Stop/Restart/Delete: the panel works out
  what this tunnel can be measured through — a layer-3 tunnel across its own
  subnet, a port forwarder through one of the mappings it already carries —
  shows what it will displace while it runs, and draws the result on a gauge.
  Mappings that cannot carry a measurement are listed with the reason rather
  than offered and then failing.

  The one thing it cannot check is the thing that matters: whether the receiver
  is running on the other server. There is no way to find that out from here, so
  it is asked rather than assumed, and a measurement against a machine that is
  not sinking fails in about a second.

- **Live bandwidth on every tunnel card.** Each card carries its own sparkline
  of what that tunnel is actually moving, animated between samples rather than
  jumping, so a tunnel that has gone quiet is visible from the dashboard instead
  of from a log.

- **Every configuration change can be undone.** `applySpec` already covered the
  loud failure: write, restart, wait, and put the old file back if the tunnel
  does not come up. The quiet failure had no cover at all — a config that starts
  perfectly well and is simply worse leaves nothing to go back to, and half an
  hour and three edits later "what was it before I started?" has no answer
  anywhere on the machine.

  Each accepted change now files the configuration it replaced, ten deep per
  tunnel, restorable from the panel and from the menu. Restoring writes the old
  file back verbatim rather than re-rendering it, so keys the edit form does not
  carry are not silently dropped. The timestamps are drawn on the traffic chart
  as well, which turns "did that change help?" from an impression into a line on
  a graph.

- **`mss` for direct tunnels.** See the MTU fix below; the knob is there for the
  paths where the automatic value is still wrong.

### Fixed

- **A dead control channel took eleven and a half minutes to notice.** The
  client's read on the control channel had no deadline of its own, so a link
  that went away without closing — the normal case for a middlebox dropping
  state, or a route change — was left to TCP keepalive. Go's `KeepAliveConfig`
  with a zero `Idle` uses a 15-second default and then nine probes at 75
  seconds: 690 seconds before the read fails. For eleven and a half minutes the
  tunnel is down, the process is healthy, the panel is green, and no new
  connection can be made.

  The read now carries a deadline derived from the tunnel's own keepalive —
  half as long again, floored at 30 seconds — so a silent path is noticed within
  a keepalive interval or two and the reconnect starts there. This was already
  right in two engines and wrong in the rest, which is a recurring fault of its
  own; there is now a test that reads the engine list out of the dispatch
  itself, so an engine cannot quietly opt out of it.

- **The client blamed the server's version for a broken path.** One closed
  handshake made it announce that the server was running an older release and
  fall back, which sent people to upgrade a server that was already current
  while the real fault — a connection closed in transit — went unexamined. The
  fallback now needs two unanswered attempts, and says both things it can be.

- **A second tunnel could be created that had no chance of working.** From a
  new user: one tunnel set up, working, in daily use; a second one made the same
  way that would not come up, with `EOF` on every handshake, forever. One or two
  others in the same chat had it too.

  Both ends have a version of this and neither was refused. On the Iran side,
  two tunnels binding the same port — the second cannot bind and dies, which at
  least appears in its own log. On the kharej side, two tunnels dialling the
  same server and port, which is worse: both start perfectly well, the server
  hands its single control channel to whichever arrived first, and the second is
  refused for as long as it runs. It is easy to do by accident — copy the tunnel
  that works, change the name, forget that the port belongs to the other end as
  much as to this one.

  Creating either is now refused at the moment it is typed, with the port to
  change named, on both the panel and the CLI wizard. `[::]` and `0.0.0.0` count
  as the same bind; two clients reaching different servers on the same port
  number do not.

- **A refused handshake said nothing at all.** A server that rejects a client —
  wrong token, or a control channel already held by somebody else — used to
  close the connection, which is indistinguishable from a network failure. The
  client retried forever and logged `EOF`, and the server logged the real reason
  at debug, where nobody was looking.

  The refusal now carries its reason to the client, which prints it and stops
  guessing: `the token does not match the server's` or `the server already has a
  control channel from somebody else`. The server logs it at warn rather than
  debug. This is backwards-compatible in both directions — an old client sees
  the same closed connection it always did.

  The scope is the transports where the fault was reported and where the
  handshake carries a reply the client is already reading: `tcp` and `tcpmux`
  understand both reasons end to end, and `kcp` and `quic` send the token
  refusal. The rest are unchanged for now.

- **The watchdog decided whether a tunnel was up by looking at the socket
  table.** `ss -Htn state established` is a poor witness: a socket stays
  ESTABLISHED long after the peer has gone, which is the exact condition the
  watchdog exists to catch. Engines now report whether they actually hold a
  control channel, and the watchdog believes that in preference to the socket.
  The report is a tri-state — connected, disconnected, or has not said — because
  during an upgrade an engine that has not been taught to report must not be
  read as reporting "down".

- **A tunnel that restarted all day looked like twenty unrelated events.** A
  watchdog restart is worth a line on its own, so "why did my tunnel reset
  overnight" can be answered. It is the wrong output for a tunnel doing it every
  three minutes: twenty separate lines are indistinguishable from twenty
  unrelated incidents across a week, and nobody reads that list and concludes
  the tunnel is flapping. Which matters, because flapping is how several real
  faults present — a path that drops full-sized packets, a liveness deadline set
  too tight — and all of them look from outside like a tunnel that mostly works,
  which is worse than one that is plainly down because nobody investigates.
  Repeated restarts inside an hour are now reported once, as one condition. The
  restarting itself is unchanged.

- **The fine-tune drawer would not open a second time.** Reported by two people
  independently: edit a tunnel, close the dialog, open it on another tunnel, and
  Fine Tune never opens again for the life of the page. Only a refresh brought
  it back.

  The drawer animates its height and cleans up when `transitionend` fires. Edit
  collapses its drawers while the form is still `display:none` — and an element
  with no boxes runs no transitions, so nothing ever started, nothing ever
  ended, and the cleanup that clears the height never ran. The drawer was left
  hidden *and* pinned to a height, which is the state that wedges it.

  Each animation now carries a token so a second one supersedes the first
  cleanly, a collapse on an element that is not being laid out lands on the
  final state directly instead of waiting for an event that cannot come, and
  every animation has a backstop timer behind the event.

- **The spoof transport carried no traffic on paths that watch TCP.** Several
  people tested it and none of them got bytes across. Three faults, and the
  first alone is enough:

  Every forged segment carried `PSH|ACK`, chosen to read as traffic on an
  established connection. That is precisely the wrong thing to look like: no
  handshake ever happened, so to anything on the path that tracks connection
  state every segment is out of state, and dropping out-of-state TCP is the
  first thing a stateful firewall does. The tunnel comes up, the sockets are
  healthy, and nothing crosses. Segments now carry `SYN`, which is the packet
  that starts a connection and which a stateful device has nothing to reject —
  as the spoof-tunnel reference sends. Receivers ignore the flags entirely, so
  this interoperates with a peer of any version.

  The sending socket was opened on the profile's own protocol, which meant the
  kernel queued a copy of every packet of that protocol on the machine into a
  buffer that was never read. It is now `IPPROTO_RAW`: send-only by definition.

  And the sequence number advanced by the payload length plus one, leaving a
  one-byte hole in the sequence space on every segment — visible to anything
  that follows a flow, and not what a real sender does. IP IDs were sequential
  for the same reason and are now random.

- **The direct tunnel stalled and had to be restarted by hand — on some servers
  and not others.** That pattern is the signature of a path MTU problem rather
  than a fault in the tunnel: the connection establishes, small packets pass,
  and the first full-sized segment is dropped by a link that cannot carry it and
  cannot say so. The socket stays ESTABLISHED throughout, which is why it looks
  like a hang rather than a failure.

  The TCP maximum segment size is now clamped on every direct connection — the
  edge dial, the accepted connection and the websocket path alike — so segments
  are sized to what the path takes. `mss` is exposed for the paths where the
  default is still too large.

- **A layer-3 tunnel crashed the process, and then would not stay up.** From
  the field, both on one server: `backpack` died with a memory fault inside the
  TUN read and systemd restarted it, and the tunnel that came back logged
  `reading from bp0: too many segments` and tore itself down every few seconds.
  Two symptoms, one wrong assumption.

  Turning on the kernel's segmentation offload — the batching added in v1.7.4 —
  changed what a read returns. It is no longer packets the kernel built to fit
  this interface. It is one run of up to 64 KB, split for us into the segments
  the *sending* side chose, whose size came from the sender's path and has
  nothing to do with the MTU here. The read buffers were still MTU-sized, and
  the split does not copy into them: it slices each buffer to the length of its
  segment and writes. A segment longer than the buffer is therefore not a short
  read but a write past the end of a slice, which takes the process down. The
  buffers are now sized to the largest run a read can return, which is the bound
  that makes it impossible rather than unlikely. Only the first page of each is
  ever touched, so what the process occupies barely moves.

  The second is the same assumption at the other end of the scale. When the
  kernel coalesces many small packets, one run can split into more segments than
  there are buffers, and the library says so. That is a short read — the packets
  that fit are perfectly good — but the pump took any error from the device as
  the device having failed, so a condition that costs a few packets cost the
  whole tunnel, over and over, for as long as the traffic causing it kept
  flowing. It is now handled as what it is, reported once a minute rather than
  once a read, and the tunnel stays up.

- **A layer-3 forwarder that could not bind reported success.** `Run` waited for
  its goroutines and then discarded their error if the context had ended, so a
  port it could not take produced a forwarder that returned nil and forwarded
  nothing. Bind failures are now returned and logged with the address that
  failed. This surfaced as a test that looked flaky and was not — twice this
  release, an intermittent failure turned out to be a real fault plus a test
  port allocator that checked a port was free and then raced another test to
  bind it. The allocator is now shared and issues each port once.

## v1.7.4 — 2026-08-23

Almost all of this release came from the field: tunnels that dropped every so
often and had to be restarted by hand, a certificate that would not issue, a
panel that could take journald to the top of `top`. Every fix below has a
regression test that fails without it.

### Added

- **The TUN device moves packets in batches.** A read used to be one packet and
  one syscall, and a busy tunnel does thousands a second. The device now comes
  from wireguard-go's `tun` package, which turns on the kernel's segmentation
  offload: one read can return a whole 64 KB run of a single TCP stream, already
  split into MTU-sized packets, for the cost of one syscall. The session and
  peer lookups moved out of the per-packet path with it — both take the state
  lock, and it was being taken twice per packet for values that change every two
  minutes. Everything above the device is unchanged: the addresses, the MTU, the
  queue, the queueing discipline and the MSS clamp still go through `ip`.

- **Speed Test measures a port forwarder, not just a full IP tunnel.** It used
  to answer "No full IP tunnel found on this server." and stop, which is true
  and useless: the menu offers the entry to everybody and most tunnels forward
  ports. A layer-3 tunnel is still measured across its private subnet; a port
  forwarder is now measured through one of the mappings it already carries — the
  side that exposes the ports connects to one on its own loopback, the side that
  holds the backends puts the sink where that mapping points. What travels is a
  real forwarded connection over the real transport, which is the thing being
  measured.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: the sink has to bind the port the real
  backend uses, so that service is down for the length of the measurement. The
  receiver checks the port is free, says plainly what it is about to displace,
  and refuses to start on top of something. Mappings that cannot carry a
  measurement — a backend on another machine, one load-balanced across several —
  are listed with the reason instead of being offered and then failing.

### Fixed

- **A layer-3 tunnel never came back after its device or carrier failed.** The
  restart loop was in place and correct, and it was never reached. `Run` waits
  for its goroutines, and the handshake and MTU-probe loops watched the caller's
  context — which outlives every generation of the tunnel — so when the pumps
  stopped, those two carried on running against a carrier that had already been
  closed, holding `Run` inside its wait forever. Nothing was reopened, while the
  handshake loop logged a retry every few seconds and made it look like the
  tunnel was busy reconnecting. Only restarting the process brought it back.

  Each generation now has its own context, cancelled the moment either pump
  stops, so the whole generation ends together and the restart happens. A
  failure on one device also releases the pump blocked on the other, which used
  to wait on a read that was never going to return.

- **A `pck` tunnel dropped every half hour or so and had to be restarted by
  hand.** Each of the client's carriers must send from its own source port:
  kcp-go tells peers apart by address alone, so two carriers sharing a port
  arrive as one peer, and a packet claiming a new conversation on an existing
  entry closes the old one. The allocator was a counter taken modulo a 128-port
  span and it never came back down, so carrier 128 was handed carrier 0's port —
  and carrier 0 is the control channel. A pool dialling every sixteen seconds,
  which is what the logs from the field showed, walks the whole span in about
  thirty-four minutes. Restarting the process worked because it started the
  counter again from zero.

  Ports are now claimed and released. One that belongs to a live carrier is
  never handed out again, however long the tunnel stays up, and exhausting the
  span is an error rather than a silent reuse.

- **The startup notes told operators to match a number that does not have to
  match.** Every KCP-family tunnel printed `both ends MUST match MTU and FEC or
  the tunnel never connects` on every start, healthy or not — the only line on a
  clean startup that sounds like a fault, so people went looking for one. Half
  of it was untrue: `SetMtu` sizes only the segments this end sends and a
  receiver parses whatever arrives, so the two ends may run different values
  quite happily. What MTU has to do is fit the path. The advice therefore sent
  people to equalise a figure that was never the problem while the real fault
  survived the change they were told to make.

  The parameters now print plainly for everyone, and the advice prints only for
  the tunnels it applies to: FEC shard counts genuinely must match, and if a FEC
  tunnel will not carry traffic the first thing to try is a lower `kcp_mtu`.

- **`kcp_mtu` defaults to 1250 when FEC is on**, down from 1350. FEC is what
  makes a too-large MTU fatal rather than merely wasteful: kcp-go pads every
  shard in a group out to the largest packet in it, so the parity packets are
  always full size. A tunnel without FEC slips its small packets through a short
  path; one with FEC offers that path a steady stream of maximum-size packets
  and loses all of them. Existing configs name the key and keep whatever they
  say; the two ends need not match, so a server can be changed on its own.

- **A tunnel could not come up behind Cloudflare over WSS**, while the same
  server worked perfectly on its IP. The client wears a browser TLS fingerprint,
  and a browser offers `h2` before `http/1.1`. Our own server pins `http/1.1` and
  so never took the `h2` on offer; a CDN terminates the TLS itself and has no
  such instruction, took it, and answered the websocket upgrade with an HTTP/2
  SETTINGS frame — which the HTTP/1.1 parser reported as
  `malformed HTTP response "\x00\x00\x12\x04..."`. A websocket cannot be
  carried over HTTP/2 at all, so offering it was the fault. The offer is now
  narrowed to what the client can actually speak.

- **Let's Encrypt certificates were never obtained.** Two faults, and either
  alone is enough. `autocert` identifies the certificate to serve by the name in
  the ClientHello and refuses outright when there is none — and a tunnel's
  remote address is normally the server's IP, which a client dials without
  sending a name. Every handshake was refused before an issuance was ever
  attempted. A handshake that carries no name is now answered with the one
  domain the listener was configured for.

  And issuance was lazy: nothing was requested until a handshake asked, so a
  failure surfaced only as a broken connection on whoever happened to arrive,
  with nothing at all on the server. The certificate is now fetched at startup
  and the answer — issued, or the exact reason not — goes in the tunnel's own
  log. Nothing was wrong with Let's Encrypt.

- **The control-channel handshake was too tight for a lossy path.** On a path
  that drops a packet the wait is not a round trip but a round trip plus however
  long TCP takes to retransmit: a second, then three, then seven. The `udp`
  transport allowed two seconds for the whole exchange on both ends, so one lost
  packet failed it — the client closed, backed off and dialled again, and the
  tunnel churned without ever reporting a disconnection. Every transport now
  uses the same named budget, generous for the same reason: failing fast here
  costs a full redial, which is far more than waiting would have.

- **The Path MTU check condemned healthy tunnels.** Two mistakes. The kernel's
  `snd_mss` already has the TCP option bytes taken out of it, so testing it
  against a figure that subtracts them a second time calls an ordinary socket
  oversized. And the ICMP probe under-reports on any path that filters large
  pings, which is ordinary on the routes this project exists for. The check now
  asks the kernel for the path MTU it learned from these very connections, uses
  the probe only as a fallback, and treats a probe that contradicts sockets
  which are visibly moving traffic as the probe being wrong.

- **One end of a datagram tunnel showed offline while the other showed online**,
  with traffic flowing the whole time. The panel asked the socket table, which
  can only see carriers that leave a socket behind — plain `kcp`, `udp` and
  `quic` dial a connected UDP socket the kernel names a peer for, but `xdi`
  rides in ICMP, `pck` builds its own TCP segments through a packet socket and
  `spoof` sends from a raw one. Only the listening side wrote down what it knew.
  Both ends record their peer now, and both are asked.

- **The panel's log drawer could take `systemd-journald` and `rsyslogd` to the
  top of `top`.** It polls every two seconds while open and every poll forked
  `journalctl -n 150`. On a host with a large journal one read can take longer
  than the gap to the next, at which point the requests overlap, each overlap
  adds another journalctl, and the load climbs on its own until the tab is
  closed. A journal read is now shared: whoever asks while one is running waits
  for it, and a result stands for two seconds — so the cost is bounded however
  many panels are open. The page also refuses to overlap its own requests and
  stops asking while its tab is hidden.

- **The panel forked `systemctl` once per tunnel per poll.** "Is this unit
  running" is the question it asks most: once per tunnel every four seconds for
  the system card, again every six for the tunnel list, each one a process and a
  round trip to systemd. The answer is now shared for two seconds — well inside
  both intervals, so nothing is less live — and anything that starts, stops or
  restarts a unit clears it, so a button press is reflected at once.

- **Editing a direct tunnel in the panel opened the reverse editor.** The server
  had answered correctly all along; the page never looked at which kind it had
  been given and fell straight through into the reverse form, which reads fields
  a direct tunnel does not have. Every box came up blank, the transport picker
  offered the wrong transports, and saving posted an empty edit that restarted
  the tunnel having changed nothing. Direct tunnels now get their own editor,
  showing what can be changed and naming — read-only — the carrier, addresses
  and side that are settled when the tunnel is made.

- **Speed Test's receiver killed the whole CLI.** The screen said "Press Ctrl+C
  when the other end reports its result" and installed no handler for it, so the
  interrupt took Go's default and ended the program — menu, tunnel list and
  whatever else was in progress. It now stops the sink and returns to the menu,
  as every other screen that asks for Ctrl+C already did. A receiver that times
  out waiting for a sender says so, rather than being indistinguishable from one
  that finished.

- **The ICMP carrier allocated twice per packet**, once to frame the payload and
  once to read one — both now come from a pool, as the pck carrier's already
  did.

## v1.7.3 — 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Direct tunnelling: Iran dials out instead of waiting to be dialled.**

  A reverse tunnel needs kharej to reach a port on Iran. Where that inbound
  connection cannot be made — a provider that filters connections arriving from
  abroad, a port blocked in one direction only — the tunnel never comes up, even
  though the user-facing ports on Iran are perfectly fine. A direct tunnel turns
  it around: Iran reaches out, which is the ordinary direction and the one a
  filter is least likely to touch. The ports do not move. Iran still exposes
  them and kharej still holds the real service.

  It is a **full IP tunnel**: a network interface on each host carrying whole IP
  packets, so the two servers get a point-to-point link over which anything can
  be routed, plus the same `ports = [...]` forwarding a reverse tunnel has. The
  packets are framed as **GRE and sealed in a Noise session**, then handed to
  one of three carriers — `pck` (raw TCP segments with no socket a firewall can
  hold), `udp`, or `spoof` (a forged source address).

  This is not the kernel's GRE. Kernel GRE travels as bare IP protocol 47:
  unencrypted, unmistakable, and removed by one firewall rule. Backpack writes
  the same header — RFC 2784, with the RFC 2890 key — and then encrypts it and
  hides it inside a carrier, so there is no protocol 47 to block. The cost is
  that it talks only to Backpack.

  **Menu → Setup Iran** (or **Setup Kharej**) **→ Direct**. Linux only: it needs
  `/dev/net/tun` and root.

- **The MTU is measured, not guessed.**

  The MTU is the one setting on a layer-3 tunnel that cannot be derived from the
  configuration, and the one that fails worst when it is wrong: set it too high
  and the tunnel comes up, answers every health check, carries ping and SSH —
  and stalls every download and every TLS handshake, because the packets that
  matter are the large ones and they are dropped out on the path with nothing
  coming back to say so.

  Once a session is up, each end sends probes padded to exactly the size a full
  data packet would be and binary-searches for the largest that is acknowledged,
  then sets the interface to match. On one pair of servers the true figure was
  **1371** against a configured **1400**, and those 29 bytes were the difference
  between a tunnel that looked healthy and one that worked.

  Probes are sealed under the tunnel session, so only a peer holding the token
  can answer one. Re-measured every 30 minutes. A peer too old to answer leaves
  the configured MTU untouched. `auto_mtu = false` turns it off.

- **The TCP segment size is clamped to fit the tunnel.** The same fault from the
  other side: two endpoints agree a segment size from *their* interfaces and
  then send segments the tunnel cannot carry, and the ICMP message that would
  correct them is dropped by a great many networks. Backpack rewrites the MSS in
  the SYN of every TCP connection leaving the interface, on both chains and both
  address families, so nothing has to be discovered.

- **Performance presets for a full IP tunnel** — Balance, Turbo and Aggressive.
  They tune the queue between the kernel and the tunnel and the carrier's socket
  buffers. All three queue with `fq_codel`, which is what lets a deep queue
  absorb a burst without becoming latency: it drops when packets start waiting,
  so the sender backs off before the queue turns into jitter.

- **Speed Test** (Manage → Speed Test). Measures what a tunnel actually carries,
  end to end — encapsulation, encryption, carrier and path together. Link Test
  next door measures latency, jitter and loss and says nothing about throughput,
  and finding out used to mean `dd | nc` on both servers by hand.

- **Direct tunnels can be created and edited from the web panel.** Add Tunnel
  now asks the direction first, then the side, then the carrier. The lists it
  offers come from the server, so the panel and the CLI wizard cannot drift into
  offering different things.

- **The kharej side refuses to dial a cloud metadata service.** The origin dials
  whatever address the stream names — that is the design, and it is why changing
  the forwarded ports touches only one machine. Private addresses stay allowed,
  because forwarding to a backend on kharej's own network is a documented use.
  The metadata addresses are the exception: they answer credentials to anything
  on the instance, so a peer holding the token could have read the kharej
  server's whole cloud identity.

### Added (documentation)
- **A `tutorial/` folder: a step-by-step setup walkthrough for every transport.**
  The docs said what each setting *is*; nothing said what to type, in what order,
  to get a working tunnel. Each page now walks the wizard question by question —
  the answer to give and the reason for it — for TCP, TCP Mux, Stealth, PCK, UDP,
  KCP+FEC, QUIC, the WebSocket pair, xDi and IP Spoofing, plus
  [before you start](tutorial/before-you-start.md) (roles, token, port mapping,
  firewall), [adding UDP to a tunnel](tutorial/udp-forwarding.md) and
  [behind a panel](tutorial/behind-a-panel.md). Every page ends with a Persian
  summary, as does every page under `docs/`.
- **[docs/ip-spoofing.md](docs/ip-spoofing.md) — the spoof carrier documented
  setting by setting**, including the ones no menu asks about: which settings
  must match the peer and which are local, every fingerprint and evasion knob
  with its config key and its cost, and how to drive the two-node tester.
- **[docs/cli-menu.md](docs/cli-menu.md) rewritten as a complete reference.** It
  was a summary that had fallen behind the menu; it now covers every option in
  every menu — both setup wizards prompt by prompt, all twelve Manage entries,
  the Edit screens for each role and transport, and the whole **Fine Tune**
  block, which was documented nowhere.
- **[docs/install.md](docs/install.md)**, holding the offline and manual install
  paths the README used to carry inline.

### Changed

- **"Setup Server" and "Setup Client" are now "Setup Iran" and "Setup Kharej".**
  The old names were already a little confusing — in a reverse tunnel the Iran
  machine is the server — and with a direct tunnel they become actively wrong,
  because there the Iran machine is the one that dials. Geography is the part
  that does not change with the direction. Each entry asks reverse or direct
  first, and the rest of the wizard follows from that answer.

- **A tunnel card shows two badges instead of one.** It used to print the
  internal name — `l3/pck` — because there was a single field where there were
  always two facts: which way the tunnel was built, and what carries it. Now it
  reads **DIRECT · PCK**, and the direction badge takes the theme's accent
  colour rather than one of its own.

- **The direct wizard asks one question about how the tunnel travels.** It used
  to ask what kind of tunnel, then how to wrap the packets. Both have a single
  sensible answer now, so both are gone; the carriers are offered in the order
  worth trying them — PCK, UDP, Spoof.

- **`nodelay` is on in every direct preset.** The engine calls
  `SetNoDelay(cfg.Nodelay)`, so leaving the key unset did not leave the socket
  alone — it turned Nagle *on*, over Go's own default of off. On a tunnel where
  one mux session carries every connection, that delays every stream at once.

### Changed (documentation)
- **The WSS decoy site is a different web server on every install, and answers
  like a file server rather than a program.** The decoy existed so a probe would
  see a website instead of a tunnel, and for one server it worked. Across the
  fleet it did the opposite: every Backpack on earth returned byte-identical
  bytes — the same trimmed page, `Server: nginx`, and nothing else. No
  `Last-Modified`, no `ETag`, no `Accept-Ranges`, the same `Content-Length`
  everywhere. One internet-wide scan for that exact response enumerated every
  Backpack server there is, no token and no probing required; a camouflage
  everybody wears identically is a uniform.

  Each install now derives its own identity from **its tunnel token** — which
  real distro nginx version it claims to be (and whether that build prints its
  version at all), when its `index.html` was written, and the `ETag` computed
  from that date and the page size in nginx's own format, so the three can never
  contradict each other. nginx changed its default page and its error pages in
  the 1.23 series, so each version serves the pages that version really ships.
  The token is secret and different everywhere, so the values cannot be
  predicted from outside; it is a hash rather than a random draw, so a server
  keeps its identity across restarts, as a real file on a real disk does.

  The responses themselves are a file server's now: `/` is served with the full
  static-file header set and honours conditional and range requests — a probe
  that hands back the `ETag` gets a `304`, not another `200` — and **every other
  path gets nginx's own `404`**, the tunnel's `/channel` included. Serving the
  welcome page on every path was the older behaviour and was a tell twice over:
  no static site answers `200` for arbitrary paths, and the tunnel path was only
  unremarkable next to the equally wrong `200` that every other path got. Being
  a `404` among `404`s hides it properly. Nothing to configure, and the two ends
  do not have to agree on any of it — the client never looks at the decoy.
- **The README is an introduction again.** It had grown into a manual: install,
  offline install, quick start, the full feature list and a link farm. What is
  left is what a first-time reader needs — what it is, how it works, install,
  the five-minute quick start, a transport table pointing at the walkthroughs,
  and the highlights (the long list is still there, folded away). Everything else
  moved into `docs/` or `tutorial/`. `README_FA.md` follows the same shape.

### Fixed

Everything below is a direct-tunnel fault found while running one on real
servers between Iran and abroad. They are listed because several presented as
the same thing — "the tunnel is up and nothing works" — and each had a different
cause.

- **A tunnel whose two ends wrapped packets differently came up and carried
  nothing.** The handshake had no encapsulation in it, so a pair with `ipip` on
  one end and `gre` on the other agreed on keys, established a session, reported
  a peer, and showed green on both panels. Every data packet then decrypted
  perfectly and was discarded one layer later, because an IPIP sender's payload
  is an IP packet and a GRE receiver reads its first four bytes as a GRE header.
  Both interfaces showed zero packets received. Nothing logged above debug.

  The encapsulation now travels in the handshake, encrypted and authenticated
  with everything else, and a mismatch is refused **by name on both ends** —
  including a GRE key mismatch, which fails in exactly the same silent way. An
  older peer that announces nothing is not judged, so an upgrade cannot take a
  working pair down.

- **The panel showed the Iran side offline while the tunnel was carrying
  traffic.** The dialling side runs a liveness probe the listening side does
  not, and the probe was a TCP connect — chosen because the transport was not
  recognised as a datagram one. `l3/pck` never matched the bare names the check
  compared against, so the panel dialled a carrier that has no socket to dial by
  design, read the inevitable refusal as the tunnel being down, and overrode a
  perfectly good "online". The kharej card stayed green because only the
  dialling side runs that probe.

- **The listening side reported no peer until traffic happened to cross it.** A
  session is promoted on the first authenticated *data* packet, which is right
  for deciding which keys to seal with and wrong for deciding what the screens
  say. An idle tunnel therefore read online on one machine and offline on the
  other. A completed handshake now publishes the peer.

- **A session was never retired.** `rejectAfterTime` was documented as the point
  a session stops being usable and was only ever applied to the replaced and
  pending ones, so a tunnel whose peer had gone away held its last session for
  as long as the process lived — and with it the peer in the metrics file, so
  the panel showed "peer connected" for a tunnel that had been down for hours.

- **Health Check told you to restore from a backup.** Its per-tunnel checks went
  through the reverse config loader, which reads `[server]` and `[client]` and
  refuses anything else by design. A healthy layer-3 tunnel came back as
  *"Config unreadable: not a client tunnel"* with *"restore from a backup"* as
  the suggested fix. It now checks what these tunnels actually have.

- **Edit did nothing for a direct tunnel in the web panel**, for the same
  reason, which is why the only way to build one was the CLI.

- **The panel reported no traffic for direct tunnels.** The reverse transports
  count inside their copy loops; these engines had no copy loop to inherit it
  from, so the card showed nothing for a tunnel moving real data.

- **A rekey was logged as a new connection.** The dialling side rekeys every two
  minutes by design, and every one printed "session ... established" — which
  read, quite reasonably, as a tunnel dropping and redialling every two minutes,
  and was reported as exactly that.

- **The MSS clamp was never installed.** The whole command was kept in one list
  and the verb was written over index 2 — which held the chain — so every
  invocation came out as `iptables -t mangle -A -o bp0 …` with no chain at all.
  iptables refused all of them and the refusal was logged at debug level, so the
  clamp was absent from every machine it was meant to protect while the code
  that built it passed its tests: they inspected the rule description, never the
  command line. The same shape was in the kernel-GRE rules.

- **Firewall rules accumulated.** A rule added on every start and removed only
  on a clean stop is a rule that piles up; one machine in the field had 546 of
  them. Every rule Backpack installs is now deleted until the delete fails
  before a new one is added, so a process that was killed rather than stopped
  leaves nothing for the next start to add to.

- **A token containing a backslash produced a config that would not parse.** The
  direct renderer wrapped strings in quotes by hand; a backslash is an escape
  character in a TOML basic string exactly as it is in a Go one. The failure was
  either a file that did not load or, worse, one that loaded a *different* token
  — and a mismatched token is answered with silence by design, so it presents as
  a blocked port.

- **Editing a direct tunnel silently deleted settings it never showed.** The
  editor re-renders the file from a spec, so every key the spec could not hold
  disappeared on an edit that had nothing to do with it: changing the MTU
  reverted a whole spoof carrier to its defaults. The carrier tables are now
  carried whole.

- **Pressing 0 to leave the layer-3 editor changed a setting.** The kharej side
  is offered fewer entries, so its indices were shifted up to compensate — and
  the shift was applied to the "go back" answer too, which landed on the UDP
  toggle and restarted the tunnel.

- **UDP flows were not counted against the connection cap.** A flow is
  recognised by its source address and UDP source addresses cost nothing to
  invent, so the one protocol where the cap matters most was the one outside it.

- **A goroutine leaked per session on the kharej side**, each holding a dead mux
  session. Nothing on a steady tunnel; a month of a flapping link is a leak with
  no symptom until the process is large.

- **CPU climbed with the packet rate for no reason.** Three allocations per
  packet: the raw connection and the destination address were rebuilt on every
  send although neither changes for the life of the socket, and the receive path
  compared the peer's address by formatting both sides into strings. At a few
  thousand packets a second that is the garbage collector doing the work rather
  than the network.

- **A tunnel with clamping turned off and no logger panicked.** The nil-logger
  guard sat below the early return, so the one combination that skipped it was
  the one that dereferenced it. Caught by CI on Linux; the non-Linux build of
  that function does nothing, so it passed locally.

- **A typo in `role` built the wrong side of the tunnel.** Both constructors set
  the role themselves before validating, so the engine's own "unknown role"
  branch could never be reached and `role = "kharje"` fell through to the Iran
  side.

- **Two layer-3 tunnels on one host collided.** The wizard offered every tunnel
  the same interface name and the same `10.10.0.1/30` — on the same screen that
  suggested running more than one between the same two servers.

- **Server setup asks about UDP forwarding in the main flow, and its firewall
  advice now matches the answer.** v1.7.2 made forwarded UDP opt-in again, for
  the QUIC reason below, but left the setup wizard describing the old default:
  after the exposed ports it still announced "These ports carry UDP as well as
  TCP" and told you to run `ufw allow <port>/udp` — on a tunnel that had just
  been created with `accept_udp = false`. The only place to turn UDP on during
  setup was a question inside "Fine-tune the advanced settings by hand", which
  defaults to *no*, so a fresh install never saw it. The result was reported as
  a TCP Mux bug: a server upgraded from v1.7.1 kept forwarding UDP (its config
  already said `accept_udp = true`, and an upgrade does not rewrite configs)
  while a fresh v1.7.2 install on the same setup carried TCP only, with nothing
  on screen to explain the difference.

  The question is now asked in the main server flow, right after the exposed
  ports it applies to, with the trade named on both sides — yes for
  Xray/Shadowsocks UDP, WireGuard, DNS and games; no for a plain web or proxy
  tunnel, whose browser QUIC would otherwise crowd out the TCP forwards. The
  firewall line that follows then names only the protocol the tunnel actually
  carries, and says where to change it later. The default is unchanged: still
  off. See [docs/forwarded-udp.md](docs/forwarded-udp.md).

## v1.7.2 — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **A Throughput preset, for `udp + kcp + fec` only.** Balance, Turbo and
  Aggressive are all gaming profiles: they differ in how much headroom they buy,
  but every one of them spends bandwidth to hold the ping steady — immediate
  ACKs, a 10 ms tick, and enough parity to repair a loss rather than wait a round
  trip for the retransmit. That is the right trade for a game and the wrong one
  for a download, and no tuning inside those three fixes it, because the cost is
  the point. This profile makes the opposite trade on the same transport: ACKs
  batched, a 20 ms tick, 10:1 parity instead of 10:4, a 4096-packet window and a
  32 MB per-stream buffer, so one stream can fill a long fat path (~210 Mbit/s at
  200 ms round trip, against ~105 on Aggressive). Measured end to end on
  loopback it carries roughly twice what Aggressive does. It is offered on the
  plain `kcp` transport alone — the other KCP carriers (xdi, spoof, pck) build
  their packets by hand and pay a syscall per datagram, so bandwidth is not what
  they are for, and on a TCP transport every knob it changes belongs to the
  kernel rather than to this process. Choosing it elsewhere is refused with a
  message saying so, rather than written to the config and quietly ignored.
  **Not a gaming preset:** with congestion control off, a window that large is a
  queue that deep. Use Turbo or Aggressive for play and this for transfers.
- **Multi-exit failover with health scoring.** A client with more than one server
  address can now steer traffic to the healthiest one on its own. A scoring loop
  measures every exit every few seconds and ranks it by
  `rtt + 2·jitter + 20·loss%` — the weighting that puts a steady 90 ms exit ahead
  of a 60 ms one that stutters — then keeps new connections on the best exit,
  with hysteresis (a challenger must be ≥15% better for three checks running)
  so the choice does not flap. It is the piece that turns a plain fallback list
  into the multi-exit gaming behaviour, and it steps off an exit as it *degrades*
  rather than only when it dies. Opt-in per tunnel (`health_failover`), asked at
  setup when a tunnel has backup addresses, and it overrides load balancing
  (steering to one best exit is the opposite of spreading across all of them).
  **Manage → Exit Health** is the manual companion: it scores and ranks every
  address on demand and offers to pin the healthiest as the primary.
- **Game Latency Test (Manage → Game Latency Test).** Estimates the in-game ping
  a player would feel through this exit without anyone installing a game or a
  config. It pings the nearest edge of popular game publishers (Dota 2, CS2,
  Valorant, PUBG, Fortnite and more) from the abroad server, measures the
  exit-to-game leg, adds the hub-to-exit tunnel leg where a TCP tunnel makes it
  measurable, and rates the result with a typical player last mile folded in.
  Test one game, every game through an exit, or a custom host. The endpoint list
  is bundled but editable (`/etc/backpack/game-endpoints.list`) — publishers move
  addresses, and many game servers filter ICMP, both of which the tool says
  plainly rather than guessing around.
- **FEC recommendation in the Link Test.** After measuring loss, the test now
  names the exact parity ratio to run on a KCP link — the setting that most
  decides how a lossy route feels — sized so the parity always clears the loss
  with burst headroom (10:5 at a few percent, 8:8 in the teens, 4:8 past 20%).
  On the CLI it offers to apply the ratio and, on a switch to KCP, sets it as
  part of the switch; the web panel shows it alongside the transport pick. Both
  ends must run the same ratio, which every screen repeats.

### Changed
- **KCP sessions run in stream mode, which is worth 5-7% on every preset.**
  kcp-go leaves stream mode off by default, and nothing here turned it on. Off,
  every write becomes its own segment and the last one goes out part-empty
  however few bytes it holds — so a tunnel carrying SMUX, whose frames are a
  header plus whatever the application happened to write, spent a share of every
  packet on padding. On, a short write is appended to the segment already queued
  until that segment is full. What rides on these sessions is a byte stream, so
  message boundaries were never meaningful, and `SetWriteDelay(false)` still
  flushes on the next tick — it costs no latency. Measured at 5-7% more
  throughput on Balance, Turbo, Aggressive and Throughput alike.
- **Aggressive is now genuinely maximal in everything that does not cost ping.**
  Socket buffers 16 → 32 MB and the per-stream mux buffer 8 → 16 MB, so flow
  control stops being what limits a transfer and a full window can land in one
  burst without the kernel dropping its tail. The KCP window deliberately stays
  at 2048: with congestion control off the window *is* the queue, and a deeper
  queue is exactly the bufferbloat a gaming preset exists to prevent — wanting a
  bigger one is wanting the new Throughput profile. Worst-case memory is
  unchanged at 16 × 32 MB.
- **UDP + KCP is now "UDP + KCP + FEC", a low-latency gaming transport.** The
  transport was already running gaming-grade ARQ on Turbo and Aggressive; it is
  now tuned that way throughout and named for what it is. Every preset — Balance
  included — runs the same latency-first ARQ (NoDelay, a 10 ms tick, Resend=2,
  KCP's own congestion window off, immediate ACKs) and carries **FEC by
  default**: Balance 10:2, Turbo 10:3, Aggressive 10:4. Send/receive windows are
  pulled back to near the bandwidth-delay product (512 / 1024 / 2048 packets)
  so that, with congestion control off, buffering — and therefore ping — stays
  bounded instead of ballooning under a large window. The trade is deliberate:
  a little peak throughput for a steadier ping, which is what a game needs.
  Existing tunnels keep their on-disk numbers until a preset is re-applied.

### Added
- **TCP + PCK — a TCP transport that does not use the kernel's TCP stack.**
  Setup → TCP → TCP + PCK. Linux, root, and both ends must be on it.

  The problem it is for is the one where a plain TCP tunnel connects and then
  dies, stalls or is throttled, and nothing in any log says why. The cause in
  those cases is usually something acting on the *connection* rather than on the
  packets: connection tracking holding state, a netfilter rule matching the flow,
  a middlebox that recognised the transfer once it got going. Every one of those
  levers is attached to the kernel's TCP stack, so this transport does not use
  it. Receive is a packet socket, which taps the device driver upstream of
  conntrack, of every netfilter chain and of reverse-path filtering; send builds
  the frame and hands it to the same driver, falling back to a raw IP socket on a
  link with no L2 header to build. KCP above supplies the reliability the absent
  stack would have, so the presets, error correction and encryption are the ones
  the `kcp` transport already uses.

  **It forges nothing.** The source address is the machine's real one and the
  ports are real, so replies route normally and none of the proving that
  [IP Spoofing](docs/transports.md) needs applies here. What does not exist is
  the connection — no handshake, no socket, no kernel state on either host —
  while the segments carry what a real one's do: timestamps on every one,
  sequence and acknowledgement numbers that track the bytes actually exchanged, a
  normal window, DSCP marking, and a flag pattern the operator can vary. Those
  are not decoration; a segment with no options, an acknowledgement of zero or a
  source port equal to its destination is classifiable on the header alone, and
  the tunnel would go on working perfectly while being trivially picked out.

  There is nothing to configure. The reference implementation this takes its
  approach from asks for the interface, the local address and the gateway's MAC,
  and spends a page of its README explaining how to find each; all three are in
  the routing and neighbour tables, so they are read. The `pck_interface` and
  `pck_gateway_mac` keys exist only to correct a wrong guess on an unusual host.

  Two firewall rules are installed on start and removed on stop: one dropping the
  kernel's RSTs for the tunnel's port — the kernel is not listening there, so it
  answers every arriving segment with one, and to a stateful device in between
  that RST is the connection ending — and one keeping the pseudo-flows out of
  conntrack. They are tagged `backpack-pck-<port>`. Without `iptables` the tunnel
  runs and is unreliable, and says so at startup. The client's source port is
  derived from the token rather than picked at random, so a reconnect reuses the
  rule instead of adding one. See [docs/tcp-pck.md](docs/tcp-pck.md).

### Changed
- **Forwarded UDP is opt-in again — off unless you turn it on.** v1.7.1 made a
  forwarded port carry UDP as well as TCP by default, to fix Xray/Shadowsocks
  UDP working nowhere. That default caused a worse problem than it solved. A
  browser's QUIC is UDP on port 443, so a plain web tunnel silently began
  carrying every QUIC flow the browser opened — and each forwarded UDP flow
  holds a pooled tunnel connection for as long as it lives. On the
  connection-pooled transports (`ws`, `wss`, and the mux family) a browser's
  many long-lived QUIC connections to a site drained the pool the TCP forwards
  shared, so the site half-loaded (images stalled while audio played) and a
  restart cleared it for a while before it filled again. Instagram, which is
  QUIC-heavy, was the usual casualty; Telegram, which is TCP, was fine.

  So `accept_udp` is off by default once more, as it was before v1.7.1. New
  tunnels carry TCP only; turn UDP on — Edit → Fine Tune → *Forward UDP…*, or
  `accept_udp = true` — for the tunnels that genuinely need it (a VPN, a game,
  an Xray/Shadowsocks inbound). **An existing tunnel created on v1.7.1 has
  `accept_udp = true` written in its config and keeps forwarding UDP until you
  turn it off** — that is the fix for the symptom above if you are hitting it.
  See [docs/forwarded-udp.md](docs/forwarded-udp.md).

- **The spoof transport's ICMP and UDP profiles now match the reference spoof
  transports on the wire — and carry the payload bare.** They used to borrow
  xdi's framing: every datagram went out with a 5-byte tag+direction prefix in
  front of the KCP packet, and the ICMP profile split the two directions into
  Echo Request (client) and Echo Reply (server). The reference transports do
  neither — an ICMP packet is a plain Echo Request in both directions, a UDP
  packet is a plain datagram, and the payload sits directly inside the L4 header
  with nothing added. What authenticates a packet as the tunnel's is the same
  thing that always did: the encryption above it, whose key comes from the
  token, plus the L4 port (UDP/TCP) or echo identifier (ICMP) that the kernel
  filter already matched on. The tag was redundant with the cipher; the
  direction byte's job — discarding the kernel's automatic Echo Reply — is now
  done by keeping only Echo Requests, since both ends send them.

  **This is a breaking wire change: both ends must run this version.** A spoof
  tunnel with one end on the old framing and the other on the new one will not
  pass traffic. The effective MTU also grows by five bytes (the dropped prefix),
  which both ends compute identically. The `tcp` profile is unframed by the same
  change. The xdi transport is untouched — it still carries its own framing,
  which is what lets several xdi tunnels share one host's ICMP socket.

### Fixed
- **"Diagnose relay" failed at the last step even when the relay was working.**
  The final check fetched `https://api.telegram.org/`, which is not an API
  endpoint — it redirects to the documentation site at `core.telegram.org` — and
  Go's HTTP client follows redirects by default. The relay only rewrites the dial
  for `api.telegram.org`, so the redirected request left the Iran server
  directly, where `core.telegram.org` resolves to the filtering blackhole
  (`10.10.34.36`) and times out. The tool then reported
  `dial tcp 10.10.34.36:443: i/o timeout` and blamed the relay for a failure it
  had caused itself — one line after proving the relay carried a TLS connection
  to Telegram. It now calls `getMe`, a real endpoint that does not redirect, with
  redirects refused outright, and reads Telegram's own answer.
- **A bad bot token reported itself as a network fault.** `telegram API returned
  status 401` is the one error that cannot be the tunnel's doing: the request
  reached Telegram and Telegram answered. It now says so — that the token was
  rejected, that the relay is fine, and to get a fresh one from @BotFather —
  and quotes Telegram's own description of any other refusal instead of showing
  a bare status number. "Diagnose relay" checks the token as part of the same
  request, so an invalid one is named at the step it belongs to.
- **The bot token could leak into error output.** Every Bot API URL contains the
  token, and Go copies the full URL into transport errors, so a failed request
  printed the credential to the screen and the journal. It is redacted now.
- **A data race on the logger's level, on every transport.** Both the client and
  the server hand one logger to all of their transports, and a transport's
  `Restart` saved the current level before quieting the log with
  `level := logger.Level` — reading the field directly. logrus does not treat
  that field as plain memory: `SetLevel` stores it with `atomic.StoreUint32` and
  every log call loads it with `atomic.LoadUint32`. A direct read is therefore an
  unsynchronised read racing an atomic write, which is a data race by definition
  and was reported as one by the detector under CI's timing. The write it raced
  with is real and reachable: the shutdown path calls `SetLevel(FatalLevel)` to
  suppress teardown noise, so any restart overlapping a shutdown could hit it.
  All fourteen sites now use `logger.GetLevel()`, which performs the atomic load.
- **TCP + PCK never stayed connected: every pool connection killed the one
  before it.** The carrier derived its source port from the tunnel token, so
  every connection a client opened sent from the *same* port. kcp-go's listener
  demultiplexes sessions purely on the sender's address
  (`l.sessions[addr.String()]`), and its rule for a packet announcing a new
  conversation on an existing entry is to close that entry — so each pool
  connection closed the session before it, the control channel included. The
  tunnel spent its life in a loop: control channel up, pool dials, control
  channel dead, `read from control channel: timeout`, restart. Aggressive made it
  worse by opening sixteen. Each carrier now takes its own port from a
  128-port range derived from the token, so every session reaches the server as
  its own peer and the TCP sequence numbers of one flow stay consistent. The
  kernel-RST rules cover the range in one set and are reference-counted, so a
  pool of sixteen no longer installs sixteen sets of iptables rules.
- **The pck send path allocated 4.2 KB per packet.** It built each frame a layer
  at a time — TCP, then IPv4, then Ethernet — allocating three times and copying
  the payload three times for every datagram. This carrier pays that per packet
  and cannot amortise it the way UDP does, because kcp-go only reaches for its
  batching write path when the socket is a real `*net.UDPConn`. Frames are now
  assembled in place into a pooled buffer: 628 ns → 296 ns and 4224 B → **zero**
  allocations per packet, with a test asserting the result is byte for byte what
  the layered builders produced. The send socket also gets an 8 MB `SO_SNDBUF`;
  only the receive socket had one, so a burst from a full window had its tail
  refused with `EAGAIN` at exactly the busiest moment.
- **The pck receive path allocated 64 KB per packet.** `ReadFrom` took a fresh
  64 KiB buffer on every call, and KCP calls it once per packet — so the garbage
  collector, not the network, was setting the pace. Pooled: 1115 ns → 44 ns.
- **A failing accept loop could pin a CPU core at 100%.** Every transport's
  accept loop retried instantly on error. That is right for the error `Accept`
  normally returns (one connection failed the handshake, take the next) and wrong
  for the two that matter: a closed listener and an exhausted file-descriptor
  table both fail immediately and keep failing, so `continue` spun as fast as the
  CPU allowed with nothing to block on. The context check at the top did not
  help, because the context was not cancelled — only the listener was broken, a
  state a tunnel restart passes through every time. Consecutive failures now back
  off geometrically to 100 ms, reset on the first success, and return at once on
  cancellation. This affected `acceptLocalConn` too, of which one runs **per
  forwarded port**. The per-iteration `listener.Addr().String()` — built on every
  accept regardless of log level — is gone with it.
- **The websocket relay used an unpooled 16 KB buffer.** The TCP relay was moved
  to a pooled 64 KB buffer for two measured reasons (a relay's cost is syscalls,
  and 16 KB took four times as many per gigabyte; and allocating per connection
  put a buffer through the GC for every connection forwarded). The ws/wss path
  was missed. It now shares the same pool.
- **The end-to-end suite could fail with `bind: address already in use` on CI.**
  Test ports were handed out from 34000-60000, which sits entirely inside Linux's
  default ephemeral range (32768-60999). The suite opens hundreds of outgoing
  connections and the kernel draws each one's *source* port from that range, so a
  port the harness had just verified free could be taken before the tunnel bound
  it. macOS starts its ephemeral range at 49152, which is why this failed on CI
  and not on a developer's machine. The harness range moved to 12000-30000,
  below both.
- **A spoof tunnel could not restart: `bind: address already in use`.** In the
  field logs, a spoof server that restarted to adopt a new client died with
  `listen udp4 0.0.0.0:58521: bind: address already in use`, and the client
  looped on the same error. The carrier transports — spoof, xdi, and pck — hand
  kcp-go a socket they open themselves, and kcp-go's `ServeConn`/`NewConn2`
  deliberately do not take ownership of a caller-provided socket: closing the
  KCP listener or session left the raw socket bound. So every restart leaked the
  previous run's receive socket, and two seconds later the new run could not
  rebind the port and exited fatally. Plain UDP never hit it because it dials
  through kcp-go's own `ListenWithOptions`/`DialWithOptions`, which own and close
  the socket. The client now builds its session with ownership set, and the
  server closes the carrier socket alongside the listener; the plain-UDP path is
  unchanged.

- **The MSS clamp the diagnostics ask for can now be set, and now does
  something.** Health Check measures the path MTU and, where the path carries
  less than the tunnel is sending, prints the exact fix: `set mss = 1208 on both
  ends`. There was nowhere to do it. The setting existed in the config format
  and in the engine, but no menu, no wizard question and no panel field ever
  wrote it — so the one fault in this system that reports itself precisely was
  also the one with no way to act on the report short of hand-editing a TOML
  file the CLI would rewrite.

  It is now **Edit → TCP MSS clamp** in the menu, a question in the manual
  tuning step of both setup wizards, and a field in the panel's Fine Tune
  drawer. It is offered only on the transports that carry TCP segments; a
  datagram transport is sized by its KCP MTU instead.

  Setting it was only half the problem. On `ws`, `wss`, `wsmux` and `wssmux` the
  value was accepted, written to the config and then dropped on the floor: those
  transports opened their sockets through `http.ListenAndServe` and a dialer
  that passed a hardcoded zero, so nothing ever reached `TCP_MAXSEG`. A clamp
  applied to a wss tunnel — the transport most of these paths use — changed
  nothing at all, which is the worse failure of the two, because the config then
  agrees with you. All four now build their listener and their dials with the
  tunnel's own options, as the `tcp` and `tcpmux` transports already did.

  Two smaller things came with it. The clamp survives a preset change, in the
  menu and in the panel both — it describes the path, not how hard the tunnel is
  being pushed, and resetting it with the rest of the tuning would have silently
  undone the fix. And the check no longer prints a number the tunnel would
  refuse: on a path below the 576 bytes IPv4 requires, no clamp helps, so it
  says the route is at fault instead of naming a value nothing will accept.

- **Ports 1 and 65535 can now be forwarded.** The config validator accepts the
  whole `1..65535` range and always has, but every transport's mapping parser
  wrote the check as `port > 1 && port < 65535`. A mapping of `1=127.0.0.1:80`
  or `65535=127.0.0.1:80` therefore failed that test, fell through to the branch
  that treats the left-hand side as a complete address, and was handed to the
  listener as the literal string `1` — which does not resolve, so the forward
  never came up while the config it came from was perfectly valid.

  All seven server transports had their own copy of that expression. They now
  share one helper, so the range is stated once rather than seven times, and
  cannot drift apart again.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#12](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/12). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the
  result — the shared helper trims its input and states the bound as an
  inclusive range, so the edge the report was about is the one the code now
  reads as valid.*

- **A forwarded port with an empty backend list took the client down.** A port
  can name several backends separated by a pipe. The pool decided it had a list
  to balance by looking for that pipe in the target — not by looking at what was
  on either side of it — so a target like `||`, which parses to no backends at
  all, still built a group with an empty list. The round-robin then indexed it
  with `next % 0` and the process panicked. The target comes off the tunnel, not
  out of this side's config, so what it contains is not this process's to assume.

  Two other things about that pool were wrong in the same direction. Every
  distinct backend list created a goroutine that probed its backends every ten
  seconds forever and a map entry that was never removed, both of them keyed by
  a string the far end chooses; a tunnel that saw many different lists grew both
  without limit, and the goroutines went on dialling backends nothing was
  routing to long after the generation that created them had stopped. The map
  is now bounded and evicts the list used longest ago, and the health checks run
  from the pick that needs them — at most one pass at a time, at most one per
  interval — so an abandoned list finishes its current pass and then costs
  nothing. A backend that recovers while no traffic is flowing is noticed on the
  next connection instead of within ten seconds, which is the moment the answer
  begins to matter.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#26](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/26). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  the group is keyed on the parsed list rather than the raw target, so spacing
  and a trailing separator no longer each get a pool of their own, and the
  last-used timestamp is read and written under the group's own lock rather
  than beside it.*

- **A `udp`, `kcp` or `quic` tunnel could fail to come back from a config
  reload: `bind: address already in use`.** Before starting the new run, the
  reload waits for the old one's ports to come free, and the only honest way to
  ask that is to try to bind them. It asked with `net.Listen("tcp", …)` whatever
  the transport was. For a datagram transport that is the wrong question: the
  TCP port of that number was free — nothing had ever bound it — while the
  previous run's UDP socket was still open. The wait returned at once, the new
  listener raced the socket that was actually still there, and lost.

  Each address is now probed on the protocol its transport actually uses. `xdi`,
  `spoof` and `pck` are left out of the wait entirely rather than guessed at:
  they read through a raw or packet socket, so there is no listener to probe,
  and opening one to find out would need the same privilege and could take
  packets from the run still shutting down. Their teardown is the transport's
  own, and the reload waits only for the web port alongside them. While in
  there, each address also got its own settling budget instead of sharing one
  across the list — a slow tunnel port used to spend the web port's wait as
  well, and the web port, the one that shuts down gracefully and genuinely needs
  waiting for, was the one that then got none.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#11](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/11). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  `pck` did not exist when it was written and is a raw-socket transport too, so
  it joins `xdi` and `spoof` in being left out of the wait instead of spending
  the whole settling timeout on a port it was never going to bind.*

- **Idle forwarded connections survived a shutdown or a reload.** The relay ran
  one direction of the copy in a goroutine and the other on the handler's own
  stack, and only looked at the context once that second copy returned. On a
  connection carrying traffic that is a distinction without a difference. On an
  idle one it is the whole problem: neither Read returns until the peer sends
  something, and on a connection nobody is using, neither ever does. The tunnel
  stopped, the generation was replaced, and the connections from the previous
  one stayed open — with their descriptors, their goroutines and their share of
  the connection quota — for as long as the process ran.

  Both directions now run independently, so cancellation is seen while both are
  blocked, and both ends are closed on the way out, which is the only thing that
  interrupts a blocked Read. The handler also waits for the second copy before
  returning rather than leaving it to finish on its own: the caller releases its
  connection quota at that point, so nothing belonging to that connection may
  still be running. One consequence worth stating plainly — the relay now ends
  as soon as *either* direction does, where it used to wait for both. That is
  what the close is for, and it is what every other relay in this project does,
  but a protocol that half-closes and then expects a reply on the other
  direction will not get one.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#18](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/18). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result —
  the waiting and closing is one shared routine both handlers call rather than
  the same dozen lines written out twice, so the two relays cannot drift apart
  on the behaviour this fix is about.*

- **The monitor page was served to the whole internet without a password, and
  now defaults to loopback.** `web_port` opened a page that reports the host's
  CPU, memory, disk, swap and network counters, the tunnel's status and total
  traffic, and — with the sniffer on — the usage of every forwarded port. It
  has never had authentication of any kind, and it was bound to every
  interface. On a server with a public address that is a live readout of the
  machine handed to anything that connects, with the port number as the only
  thing in the way.

  It now binds to `127.0.0.1` and is reached the way the profiling endpoint
  already is:

  ```
  ssh -L 2060:127.0.0.1:2060 root@server
  ```

  **This changes where an existing tunnel's monitor page answers.** If you open
  it over the network today, set `web_bind = "0.0.0.0"` to have it back exactly
  as it was — the key is written into every config that has a `web_port`, so it
  is there to find and edit, and unlike a hand-added setting it survives the
  next time the menu or the panel rewrites the file. A single address works too
  (`web_bind = "10.0.0.5"`), for serving it on a private network and nowhere
  else. Whenever the page is bound anywhere but loopback, startup says so.

  The page itself got the boundaries it never had: `GET` and `HEAD` only,
  unknown paths answered as missing instead of rendering the dashboard,
  `no-store` and the usual hardening headers on every response, and header,
  read, write and idle timeouts on the server — without which a handful of
  connections that open and go quiet hold their goroutines for as long as the
  process lives. Two handlers that logged a failure and returned an empty `200`
  now return a `500`, so a monitor that cannot collect stats says so rather
  than looking like one reporting nothing.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#24](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/24). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  the pull request bound the page to loopback outright, with nothing an
  operator could do about it. Anyone watching that page from another machine
  would have lost it on upgrade with no way back, so it is a default here
  rather than a rule — `web_bind`, carried through the config writer and the
  edit path so the CLI and the panel cannot silently drop it.*

- **Turning profiling off, or reloading a tunnel that has it on, left the old
  listener holding the port.** `pprof = true` started the endpoint with
  `http.ListenAndServe`, which serves the process-wide default mux and returns
  only on failure — so there was no server to shut down and no way to know when
  it had. Disabling profiling in the config did not close the socket that was
  already open, and a reload built the next generation while the previous one
  still had 127.0.0.1:6060; if that generation wanted profiling too, it raced
  the port and lost.

  Profiling is now an explicit server tied to the generation's context, with
  its handlers named one by one rather than inherited from the default mux —
  which matters because that mux is shared with every package in the build that
  registers something in an `init` function, and anything there was reachable
  on the profiling port without a decision being made. `Start` does not return
  until the port is released, so the reload's wait for a free port is waiting
  for something that will actually come.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#29](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/29). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  the read and write deadlines it put on the profiling server are gone, because
  a CPU profile is a thirty-second response by default and a trace is longer —
  deadlines there would have cut off the one thing the port exists for. The
  header timeout and the header-size cap, which a slow client runs into and a
  profile never does, are what remain.*

- **An interrupted backup left a truncated archive under a name that said it
  was whole.** The archive was written straight to its final path, so a backup
  cut short by a full disk, a reboot or a killed process left a partial file
  called `backpack-backup-….tar.gz` — which the retention policy then counted
  as one of the ten kept, and a restore accepted as far as the point it stopped.

  Worse, the write could report success over a short archive even without a
  crash. The tar writer and the gzip writer were closed by `defer`, and a
  deferred `Close` reports to nobody — but closing them is what writes the
  archive's footer and the compressed trailer, so a failure exactly there was
  discarded and the backup was called good.

  Backups are now written to a temporary file beside the destination, fsynced,
  and renamed into place only once complete, so a file under the real name is
  always a whole archive. Both closes are checked and reported. Every file is
  closed as it is archived rather than at the end of the walk — the close was
  deferred inside the walk callback, which meant every file in the tree stayed
  open until the last one was written, and a large enough config directory ran
  the process out of descriptors. Anything in the tree that is not a directory
  or an ordinary file is now refused by name: a symlink produced a header with
  no target recorded and no content behind it, so the archive looked complete
  and was not.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#27](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/27). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  the directory entry is fsynced after the rename as well, because syncing only
  the file leaves the rename itself able to reach the disk after a crash and
  the archive to be correctly named and empty; the second backup taken in the
  same second gets a suffix instead of replacing the first; and a partial file
  abandoned by a hard crash is swept up after an hour rather than staying in
  the backup folder for the life of the host. The archive writer and the
  publishing are separate functions now, so both are covered by tests that need
  neither a real `/etc/backpack` nor a real crash.*

- **A bad backup archive used to half-restore, leaving an installation that
  came from neither the backup nor from what was there before.** Restoring
  extracted straight into the live config directory, one entry at a time, as
  the archive was read. Every way an archive turns out to be bad is found
  part-way through reading it — a truncated upload, a gzip checksum that only
  fails at the very end, a path trying to escape the directory, a read error
  half way — and by then some tunnels had been overwritten and some had not,
  with nothing kept to put them back.

  The whole post-restore tree is now built in a staging directory beside the
  live one first: the current configuration copied in, the archive laid over
  the top, every entry checked before it is written, and the compressed stream
  read through to its checksum. Only then does anything in the live directory
  change, and the change is a rename. A restore that fails now leaves the
  installation exactly as it found it, and says why.

  What the archive may contain is bounded too. Paths are checked as names
  rather than by where they happen to land, so the answer does not depend on
  what is already on disk; a backslash is refused outright, since it is a
  separator where these archives can also be opened. Anything that is not a
  file or a directory is refused — a symlink or a hard link is the standard way
  an archive reaches outside the directory it is unpacked into, and a backup of
  this system contains neither. The same path twice is refused. And there are
  ceilings on the number of entries, the size of one file and the total
  expanded size, so a corrupt or hostile archive cannot fill the disk before
  anyone learns what is in it.

  Restores still merge rather than replace: a backup taken by an older version
  does not know about files a newer one added, and this host's `install_path`
  still wins over the archived one.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#28](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/28). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  it swapped the config tree without first copying the current one in, so
  restoring an older archive would have deleted every file added since it was
  taken. Seeding the staging directory is what keeps the merge behaviour
  restores have always had — and refusing, before the commit, to swap over
  anything in the live tree that cannot be copied is what keeps that swap from
  quietly dropping something on the way through.*

- **The panel's login could be used to grow its memory from outside, and its
  cookies were missing the attribute that keeps them off plain HTTP.** The
  rate limiter remembers one entry per source address and only ever forgot an
  address that came back, so an address that failed once and never returned
  stayed for the life of the process — and the panel sits on a port that gets
  scanned by hosts that rotate their source. The entry table is now bounded.
  Which entry it gives up matters as much as that it gives one up: an address
  is stamped when it fails, so the one that just hit the limit is the least
  recently seen thing in the table, and evicting by age alone would have let a
  flood of fresh addresses lift the block on the attacker producing them. A
  blocked address is never the one dropped.

  Session and pending-login cookies now carry `Secure` when the panel is
  actually serving over TLS, so they are not sent in the clear. They stay
  `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax` as before, and they are all built in one place
  now rather than in three with slightly different flags — including the ones
  that clear them, which a browser ignores unless the attributes match.

  Responses carry the headers the panel had none of: `X-Frame-Options`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and a content security policy
  that forbids framing, for a page that creates, edits and restarts tunnels.
  The two endpoints that run before any authentication no longer read a request
  body of any size into memory to find two short form fields in it. And the
  listener gained a header timeout, a header-size cap and an idle timeout —
  `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout` were already set; these are what a
  connection that opens and then says nothing runs into.

  [#23](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/23). We reviewed that pull
  request, finished it and improved on it, and what shipped here is the result:
  `Secure` is set on evidence of TLS — this connection, or a panel configured
  for HTTPS — and never on `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which anyone can send and which
  on a plain-HTTP panel would have logged its owner in and then treated every
  request after that as a stranger's. The origin checks it added to mutating
  endpoints are not here either: `SameSite=Lax` already keeps cookies off
  cross-site POSTs, and an origin check is the thing most likely to break a
  legitimate deployment behind a reverse proxy for a case that is already
  covered.*

- **A single empty WebSocket frame could stop a `ws`, `wss`, `wsmux` or
  `wssmux` tunnel dead.** The control channel carries one-byte signals —
  heartbeat, open a channel, closed — and all four read loops went straight to
  `msg[0]` on whatever arrived. That is correct for every frame either end of
  this tunnel has ever sent, and fatal for one it has not: indexing an empty
  frame panics, and the panic takes the process with it. The control channel is
  reachable by whatever holds the token, so a tunnel that can be stopped by one
  zero-length frame is not one that should be.

  A frame that is not exactly one binary byte is now logged and dropped, and
  the loop reads on.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#22](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/22). We reviewed that pull
  request and took the part of it that fixes the crash. The rest of it changes
  how live tunnels behave — read limits on the tunnel connections, a shorter
  handshake timeout, and replacing the deliberate `IdleTimeout: -1` on the
  WebSocket listeners with a write and idle deadline — and those are throughput
  and stability questions to answer with measurements on a real link, not
  alongside a crash fix. Its response to a malformed frame is also not ours:
  the pull request closes the control channel and restarts the transport, which
  hands anyone who can reach that channel a way to keep a tunnel restarting.
  Dropping the frame leaves a working tunnel exactly where ignoring it always
  left it.*

- **The monitor page collected the host's statistics once per request, and
  could crash the tunnel doing it.** One collection samples the network
  counters, sleeps a whole second so a rate can be worked out, and then walks
  the process table to count connections. The dashboard polls on a timer, so a
  page left open on two screens meant two of those, each holding a goroutine
  asleep for a second and each doing the walk again — and anything scraping the
  endpoint faster multiplied it from there, on the page that exists to report
  how the host is doing.

  A collection is now shared: whoever arrives while one is running waits for it
  and gets its result, and a result stays good for two seconds. The tunnel's
  own status and traffic total are refreshed on the way out, so the two figures
  that describe the tunnel are still live — only the part that was slow to get
  is reused. A failure is not cached, so a host that could not be read a moment
  ago is asked again rather than reported as broken for the next two seconds.

  Two crashes went with it. The CPU sample comes back as an empty slice rather
  than an error when the kernel has nothing to give — briefly at boot, and
  where the counter has not moved — and indexing it took the whole tunnel down
  over a number on a status page; the same was true of the network counters.
  Both are checked now.

  The tunnel's traffic total was written by the save loop and read by the stats
  endpoint with nothing between them, on a plain integer. It is atomic now, and
  published once at the end of a save rather than zeroed and added back a port
  at a time — which is what let a poll land mid-rebuild and report the tunnel
  as having carried nothing. The usage file is serialised too: the save is a
  read-modify-write, it runs on a timer in its own goroutine, and a save slower
  than the tick used to be joined by the next one, with whichever finished last
  discarding the other's totals. Reading is under the same lock, so a page load
  cannot catch the file half-written. And the first read of a fresh install
  creates that file and now closes it.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#25](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/25). We reviewed that pull
  request; the largest thing in it — the shared tunnel-status string, rewritten
  by transports while the stats endpoint read it — had already been fixed here
  since, so what shipped is the rest of it, reviewed and finished. The
  accounting lock is deliberately not the one the cache and the file use:
  traffic is accounted once per read on every forwarded connection, so putting
  disk work or a one-second collection behind that lock would have paid for a
  monitoring page out of the tunnel's throughput.*

- **A tunnel using a Let's Encrypt certificate stopped renewing it after the
  second reload.** The HTTP-01 responder was started with a bare `go` on every
  TLS configuration built, and nothing ever stopped it. One process builds
  another on every reload, so the second reload found port 80 held by the
  responder the first run had left behind: it logged that it could not have the
  port and carried on. What was still answering on 80 was the *old* manager,
  belonging to a generation that had been torn down, with the configuration and
  cache directory it was built with rather than the ones now in force. Renewal
  then depended on TLS-ALPN, which only works when the tunnel is on 443 — off
  443 it simply stopped, silently, and the first anyone would know is a
  certificate expiring ninety days later.

  There is now one responder for the life of the process, started once and
  pointed at whichever manager is current. It holds no state of its own —
  everything a challenge needs lives in the manager — so a reload only has to
  swap the pointer. A port that cannot be taken is still reported and survived
  rather than fatal: a tunnel on 443 validates over TLS-ALPN and needs no
  responder at all.

  *Thanks to [@dr-hoseyn](https://github.com/dr-hoseyn), who raised this in
  [#21](https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack/pull/21). We reviewed that pull
  request and took the problem it identified rather than its solution. It
  builds a registry with reference-counted leases, a retry loop and a scheme
  for sharing the challenge port between separate processes — several hundred
  lines, on the path where a mistake means no certificate and where Let's
  Encrypt's rate limits punish finding out the hard way. One process runs one
  tunnel here, so the fix that matters is one listener that survives a reload,
  and that is about forty lines. The responder also gained the header and idle
  timeouts every other listener in this project has.*

## v1.7.1 — 2026-08-10

Two halves. The web panel stops being a window and becomes a way to work: it
creates, edits and drives tunnels itself, so the CLI is a choice rather than the
only door. The other half is the UDP side of the engine: the three transports
that carry their data in datagrams — udp, kcp (and xdi, which is kcp over ICMP) —
plus quic, which joins them.

### Fixed
- **A forwarded port carries UDP now, on every transport.** This is the one
  reported as "UDP does not pass through BackPack" with 3x-ui/Xray and
  Shadowsocks, worked around by building a GRE tunnel underneath and running
  Backpack over that. The workaround was sound and the diagnosis was right: the
  UDP was never reaching Backpack's forwarded port, because nothing was
  listening for it.

  A forwarded port opened a TCP listener and nothing else. Datagrams were
  refused by the kernel; nothing was logged, so the port looked healthy and half
  of it silently was not there. There *was* an `accept_udp` setting, but it was
  off by default, undocumented, and honoured only by the plain `tcp` transport —
  the management layer deleted it from the config whenever the transport was
  anything else. So on `tcpmux`, `ws`, `wss`, `wsmux`, `wssmux`, `kcp` or
  `quic`, which is most tunnels, forwarded UDP could not be turned on at all.

  It now works everywhere, and it is on by default: expose `443` and the tunnel
  listens on 443/tcp and 443/udp both. Each source address becomes a flow that
  is paired, limited, counted and torn down by exactly the code that already
  does it for a TCP connection — a datagram flow is handed to the transport
  wearing the same shape, so there is no second implementation to drift. The
  flow is marked in the target address rather than in a new header byte, which
  is why this needed no change to any transport's framing. Datagrams are
  length-prefixed, so a packet that goes in as one message comes out as one
  message of the same size.

  **Open the port for UDP in your firewall** — `ufw allow 443/udp` — TCP is not
  enough, and it is the first thing to check if this still does not work. Both
  ends must be on v1.7.1: a client that predates it logs a resolve error for the
  UDP flow and carries TCP as before. `accept_udp = false` still turns it off
  per tunnel, and a UDP port that cannot be bound now warns and leaves the
  tunnel running instead of killing the server. See
  [docs/forwarded-udp.md](docs/forwarded-udp.md).

  Three faults in the old path went with it. A source address whose flow could
  not be started was recorded anyway and never removed, so one full channel
  blackholed that peer until the service was restarted — the signature being
  "UDP worked, then stopped, and a restart fixes it". The client leaked a
  goroutine and a file descriptor per flow, forever, so a busy client eventually
  ran out of descriptors and stopped accepting anything. And congestion was
  judged by comparing a timestamp from one machine against the clock of the
  other: two servers do not share a clock, so a kharej host a second ahead made
  every packet look a second late, flagged every flow as congested, and tore
  them down in a loop. That measurement was never sound and is gone rather than
  corrected.

- **The `udp` transport could silence a peer permanently.** The same fault, in
  the one place the rewrite above does not reach. A forwarded flow that waits
  more than three seconds for a tunnel connection is given up on — which happens
  whenever the pool is briefly empty, and always happens when traffic arrives
  before the client has finished connecting. Giving up removed the flow from
  service but left its source address in the table, and nothing else ever
  removed it, so every later datagram from that peer was filed against a payload
  channel no goroutine was reading. The peer went quiet for good; restarting the
  service was the only cure. The flow is now dropped whole, so the next datagram
  from that address starts a fresh one.

  A second, smaller fault went with it: the tunnel-side table was written
  without its lock on one path, which is a data race that can corrupt a Go map
  outright.

  Worth saying plainly, though: the `udp` transport carries datagrams with no
  retransmission, no ordering and no error correction, so on a lossy or
  throttled route it will still do far worse than **UDP + KCP** — and since this
  release you do not need it to forward a UDP service at all. Any transport
  does that now.

### Added
- **The web panel builds and manages tunnels.** It used to say "monitoring
  only" in the corner of the Tunnels heading, and it meant it: every tunnel was
  created, edited and restarted from the CLI over SSH. That corner now holds
  **Add Tunnel** and **Restart all**.

  Add Tunnel asks which side this machine is — Iran (server) or kharej (client) —
  and then asks the setup wizard's own questions, in the wizard's own order:
  transport family, transport, name, tunnel port, forwarded ports, token,
  performance preset, Fine Tune, IPv6 and PROXY protocol. The port fields carry a
  button that suggests a free four-digit port, the token is generated for the
  server side and copyable in one click, and Fine Tune opens on the preset's own
  numbers, marking the tunnel custom only if one of them is actually changed.

  Every card gained an **Edit** button beside Logs and Details, and a row of
  **Start / Stop / Restart / Delete** beneath them. Edit changes the server
  address, the transport, the tunnel port, the forwarded ports, the preset and
  the advanced settings — all of it applied in one write and one restart, and
  reverted to the previous config if the tunnel does not come back up.

  None of this is a second implementation. The transport and preset menus are
  served from the same tables the CLI menu reads, and every form posts to
  `manage`, so a tunnel built in the browser is the same file as one built in the
  terminal. The endpoints sit behind a panel session; the read-only remote token
  still cannot change anything.
- **QUIC is available as a transport.** It carries the tunnel inside QUIC
  streams over UDP: its own TLS 1.3, its own stream multiplexing, congestion
  control and loss recovery, so every byte is encrypted and there is nothing to
  hand-tune. Pick **UDP + QUIC** in Setup, or set `transport = "quic"`.

  It is offered, not recommended. v1.5.0 records QUIC being built, tested on a
  real Iran route, and dropped because it never completed a handshake there while
  KCP on the same link ran at full speed. That finding still stands and nothing
  since has disproved it, so the benchmark's advisor keeps recommending KCP for a
  lossy link and names QUIC only as the other thing to try. Test it on your own
  route before committing to it.

### Fixed
- **A client that restarted on its own left a dead tunnel behind, on every
  datagram transport.** The server accepted exactly one control channel claim per
  run. When the client restarted — a crash, a service restart, an edit — it
  re-dialed with a fresh claim, and the server discarded it as a duplicate,
  because as far as that run was concerned it already had a control channel.

  Nothing corrected it. A datagram transport has no RST to deliver the news: on
  KCP the server's control-channel read simply blocks and a heartbeat write to a
  silent peer is buffered rather than refused, so the dead session stayed
  "established" indefinitely and the tunnel was down until someone restarted the
  server by hand. The server now keeps accepting claims for the whole run, and a
  second one that passes the token check makes it rebuild and adopt the new
  client. The decision sits on the token, never on the bare connection, so a peer
  that does not know the secret cannot force a restart loop. There are end-to-end
  tests for both halves on udp, kcp and quic, each driven by a real client
  restart behind a cut path.

- **UDP sockets kept the kernel's default buffers, whatever `so_rcvbuf` and
  `so_sndbuf` said.** The settings were honoured on the TCP transports and
  ignored on udp, on both ends. The kernel default is small enough that a
  datagram flood — a speed test, a busy game server — overruns it, and the
  packets it cannot hold are dropped before any goroutine reads them, which
  looked like the tunnel stalling under load. Every UDP socket the transport
  opens is now sized to the configured value.

- **One bad forwarding target took down the whole udp client.** A target address
  that would not resolve, or a UDP dial that failed, called `Fatalf` and killed
  the process — every other tunnelled port with it. A failed dial also fell
  through and dereferenced the nil connection one line later. Both now drop the
  one flow and let the rest of the tunnel carry on.

- **The udp control-channel handshake leaked a goroutine on every restart.** Its
  accept loop had no way to be woken, so it sat blocked on the old listener past
  the restart that replaced it. The listener is now closed when the run ends. The
  control connection also gets TCP keepalive, so a peer that dies without closing
  surfaces as a read error instead of a connection that hangs open forever.

- **`proxy`, `local_addr`, `interface` and `so_mark` were accepted on quic and
  silently ignored.** They apply to the TCP dialer, which a quic tunnel does not
  use for anything — not even its control channel, which is a QUIC stream. They
  are now refused at load time on quic, as they already were on udp, kcp and xdi.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-08-04

This one started from a report that the tunnel worked on most servers and not on
some, with no error that said why. Chasing it down found several separate causes
of exactly that symptom, all of them old, and all of them in the part of the code
that decides whether a connection is allowed to exist at all.

**Upgrade the server first, then the clients.** Three things now settle
themselves between the two ends rather than being assumed, and all three fall
back to the old behaviour when one end is older — but a new server with old
clients is the combination that degrades most gracefully.

### Fixed
- **A wss tunnel could not sit behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.** The wss
  credential is a proof bound to the client's TLS session — which stops an
  intermediary that terminated the TLS from replaying it, and also stops a
  *legitimate* one, like an NGINX reverse proxy in front of the server, because
  the proxy holds a different session and the bound proof can never match. There
  was no way to run that setup at all. A new `simple_auth` option authorises on
  the raw token instead, the same credential the plain ws transport already
  sends:

  ```toml
  simple_auth = true
  ```

  It is off by default, because without a trusted proxy it hands the token to
  whoever terminates the TLS. Set it on both ends when a proxy is doing so.

- **Backpack squatted the well-known SOCKS port 1080 on every install.** The
  monitor bound `127.0.0.1:1080` unconditionally, as a fallback for tunnels
  written before the relay port was derived from the token. On a machine that
  also runs a panel or an xray SOCKS inbound on 1080, backpack boots first, wins
  the port, and the other service quietly loses it — the panel's nodes drop after
  a reboot, and the only way anyone found to clear it was to uninstall backpack.
  It now binds 1080 only when a tunnel actually still maps to it, and leaves it
  alone otherwise. Nothing that uses the derived port — every current tunnel, and
  every fresh install — touches 1080 at all.

- **A tunnel would connect and then carry nothing, for any client that dials out
  from more than one address.** The server accepted a pool connection only if its
  source address matched the control channel's. Behind carrier-grade NAT, on a
  multi-homed host, behind a SNAT pool or a load-balanced gateway, the pool dials
  from a different address than the control channel did, and every one of those
  connections was discarded. The control channel was fine, so the tunnel reported
  itself connected and simply moved no traffic.

  Pool connections now prove what they know instead of where they came from: the
  server issues a random nonce when the control channel comes up, and each pool
  connection presents it. Source address is out of the decision entirely. A
  client too old to present one still works, on the old rule, with a warning
  saying so.

- **On some kernels the tunnel could not open a single socket.** Every socket —
  outgoing connections included — asked for `SO_REUSEPORT`, and a kernel or
  container that refuses the option failed the dial or the listen outright. It is
  no longer asked for at all.

  Where it *worked* it was worse. `SO_REUSEPORT` is a deliberate request to let
  another process bind the same port, so a leftover process from a crash or an
  upgrade no longer collided with "address already in use" — it quietly took a
  share of the arriving connections, and the client's control channel and its
  pool ended up on different processes.

- **A port scanner could keep the tunnel's own client from connecting.** The
  server read each new connection's token in a single loop, one connection at a
  time, blocking up to two seconds on each. Anything that connected and said
  nothing cost every connection queued behind it the full timeout. Each
  connection is now handled in its own goroutine.

- **Only the first address a server name resolved to was ever tried.** A name
  with several A records — the ordinary way to publish more than one route to
  the same machine — was resolved to a single address and that address dialled
  forever. If it was the filtered one, the tunnel never connected while every
  other record sat there working. Every resolved address is now tried in turn,
  with IPv4 and IPv6 raced as usual.

- **A restart could rebind ports after the tunnel had been told to stop.** The
  restart path waits two seconds before rebuilding, and did not check whether the
  tunnel was still meant to be running. On shutdown it leaked listeners; with the
  new configuration reload it fought the run replacing it for its own ports.

- **The control channel gave up after two seconds.** That has to cover a round
  trip plus whatever the server takes to answer, and on a long or lossy path — the
  ordinary case here, not the exceptional one — a single retransmitted SYN can eat
  most of it. It is fifteen seconds now; failing fast bought nothing, because
  failing means backing off and dialling again.

- **`mux_streambuffer` did nothing on the default mux version.** smux only applies
  a per-stream window on version 2; on version 1 there is no per-stream flow
  control at all. The setting was accepted, shown back by the panel, and ignored.
  It is now either applied or reported as inapplicable.

### Added
- **Reach the tunnel server through a proxy.** A client that cannot open an
  arbitrary outbound connection can be pointed at one:

  ```toml
  proxy = "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
  proxy = "http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8080"
  ```

  Only the connections that reach the server go through it; the dial to the local
  backend never can, by construction rather than by rule. Not available on the
  `udp` and `kcp` transports, whose data is carried in datagrams a TCP proxy
  cannot relay — configuring it there is refused at startup rather than half
  working.

- **Choose which way out of a multi-homed machine the tunnel leaves by.** On a
  server with two uplinks the kernel's routing table decided, and the only way to
  influence it was to change routing for the whole machine. Three ways to say it
  instead, in increasing order of what they need from the system:

  ```toml
  local_addr = "192.0.2.10"   # bind the source address — needs no privilege
  interface  = "eth1"          # pin to a device — Linux, needs CAP_NET_RAW
  so_mark    = 100             # fwmark for `ip rule` — Linux, needs CAP_NET_ADMIN
  ```

  Any of these that is configured and cannot be applied fails the connection,
  rather than being logged and skipped. They were asked for by name, and a tunnel
  that quietly ignored "leave by eth1" would send traffic out the wrong link
  while reporting itself healthy. Like the proxy, none of it touches the dial to
  the local backend, and none of it is available on the datagram transports —
  configuring it there is refused at startup.

- **Editing a tunnel's configuration file now takes effect on its own.** The file
  is watched, and a change stops the tunnel and starts it again from the new
  configuration in the same process. A file that does not parse is ignored and
  reported, so a half-saved file or a typo cannot take a working tunnel down; a
  file that means the same thing is ignored silently, so touching it or editing a
  comment does not drop every connection it is carrying.

- **Stealth records carry random padding.** Encryption settles what is in a
  record and says nothing about how big it is, and record sizes are one of the
  few things left for an observer to work with. Each record now carries a random
  amount of filler, inside the encryption — both the length and the filler are
  under the AEAD, so all that reaches the wire is a record whose length moved.

- **A new experimental transport, `xdi`, tunnels inside ICMP echo.** It is for
  the one network where UDP and TCP are filtered but ICMP is not — the tunnel
  rides in ping packets, which such a network is unwilling to drop because ping
  is how it proves itself reachable. It is the KCP transport with its packets in
  echo requests and replies instead of UDP datagrams; everything above the packet
  layer — the reliability, the error correction, the encryption — is identical,
  so the `aggressive` preset drives it to the same throughput as KCP.

  ICMP has no ports, so a raw ICMP socket receives every ping the host sees.
  Several `xdi` tunnels on one machine stay out of each other's way — and out of
  the way of stray pings and the kernel's own automatic replies — by a session
  tag derived from each tunnel's token: a packet without this tunnel's tag is not
  this tunnel's packet, and is dropped without a second look.

  It is Linux only and needs a raw socket (root, or `cap_net_raw`), refused at
  startup with that said plainly if it does not have one. Slower than the other
  transports and heavier on ICMP rate limits, so it is a last resort, not a
  default.

- **Zero-copy forwarding, off by default.** Where both ends of a forwarded
  connection are plain sockets, the bytes can be moved by the kernel instead of
  being copied out into the process and back. It is the fastest path here and
  the least proven, so it is opt-in per tunnel:

  ```toml
  zero_copy = true
  ```

  Nothing about it reaches the wire, so the two ends need not agree — it can be
  enabled on one side, or on one tunnel, while everything else keeps the path it
  has always used. It applies only to the plain `tcp` transport on Linux, and
  only where the tunnel has no bandwidth limit; anything else silently keeps the
  buffered copy, and the tunnel says which it is actually using in its log every
  five minutes, because "enabled" and "in effect" are not the same thing.

- **Health Check answers the two questions a tunnel could not answer about
  itself.** How much of the pool is really there — a control channel with none
  behind it looks healthy from every other angle while forwarding nothing — and
  whether the path can carry a full-sized packet. The second one is measured
  rather than assumed: where a network drops oversized packets without returning
  an ICMP message, TCP never finds out, so the handshake and the heartbeats
  arrive, the tunnel comes up and stays up, and every real transfer stalls. It
  now reports the measured path MTU against the segment size the sockets are
  actually using, and names the `mss` to set.

### Changed
- **`mux_version` is negotiated rather than assumed.** smux has no version
  negotiation of its own: every frame carries the number, and the first frame
  whose number is not what the reader expects tears the session down. Because the
  control channel is not muxed, a disagreement did not look like a failure — the
  tunnel connected and carried nothing.

  Leaving `mux_version` out (or at `0`) now has the server settle it on the
  control channel and the client use what it is told. An explicit `1` or `2` is
  still honoured on the server side. A client too old to be told anything keeps
  to version 1, as it always did.

- **Forwarded connections copy through 64 KB buffers, taken from a pool.** They
  were 16 KB, freshly allocated per direction per connection. A relay's cost is
  syscalls, and the buffer size sets how many a gigabyte takes.

## v1.6.5 — 2026-08-01

The panel is checked from a phone more often than from a desktop, so it installs
as one now. Getting there needed a certificate, which needed a terminal — that
is a Settings screen too. And the release before this one shipped a broken brace
that quietly emptied the Health Check.

### Fixed
- **Health Check and Alerts came up empty.** Both write their rows and then ask
  the page to re-translate itself, and `applyLang` assigns `textContent` to
  every element marked `data-i18n` — including the containers those rows had
  just been written into. The results were overwritten by the placeholder the
  markup shipped with, in the same tick they arrived. The hostname in the header
  was being reset the same way between polls.
- **The accent picker multiplied.** A merge had joined `function relang(){` to
  the comment that opened the accent section, so the closing brace ended up
  sixty lines further down and the whole block — the palette, the swatch builder
  and a GitHub request — became the body of a function called on every render.
  Six swatches became twelve, then eighteen, depending on how many panels you
  had opened. It also meant none of it ran on page load.
- **Settings toggle labels sat under their switch instead of beside it.**
  `.modal label` sets `display:block` and outranks a bare `.tg`, so the flex row
  never applied inside Settings. Invisible while the control was a small
  checkbox; obvious once it became a 40px switch.
- **Location and ISP were usually blank.** The public address was resolved once,
  behind a `sync.Once`, and the panel starts from systemd at boot — often before
  the network is up. One failed lookup then stuck for the life of the process,
  and the geo lookup that depends on it never had anything to work with. Both
  are now refreshed in the background, retried while incomplete, and never block
  a request.
- **Changing the panel port redirected to `http://`** even when the panel was
  serving HTTPS.

### Added
- **Install the panel as an app.** A service worker, a proper manifest and real
  bitmap icons — including a maskable one for Android and a PNG for iOS, which
  ignores SVG for a home-screen icon. On a phone or tablet the panel offers to
  add itself once: one tap where the browser supports it, the Share-menu steps
  on iOS where it does not. The worker caches nothing on purpose — this is a
  live dashboard behind a login, and a cached reading of a server is a wrong one
  — so it exists for installability and answers a failed page load with an
  offline card.
- **Panel certificate, in the panel.** Settings → Panel access → Certificate,
  with the same three choices as the CLI. Let's Encrypt is only offered when it
  could actually succeed: the panel checks that the domain resolves to this
  server and that a validation route exists (port 443 for TLS-ALPN, or a free
  port 80 for HTTP-01), and refuses with the reason when it does not. Getting
  that wrong restarts the panel onto a listener that can never complete a
  handshake, and whoever pressed the button has a browser and no shell.

### Changed
- **Total traffic is the sum of the tunnels**, not the machine's interface
  counters. It is now exactly the total of what the cards show, rather than a
  larger figure including ssh, apt and the panel itself — and it survives a
  reboot, which the interface counters do not. Up and down speed still come from
  the interface: that answers what the box is doing now.
- **The health pass probes tunnels concurrently.** Sequentially, a client tunnel
  whose server is down cost the full four-second timeout each, and enough of
  them ran past the panel's 30-second write timeout — cutting off the response
  mid-flight.

## v1.6.3 — 2026-07-29

The panel gets a clear-out. The header carried six facts nobody reads twice,
the tile row carried eight figures to answer four questions, and the menu would
not close. All of that is smaller now, the accent colour is yours to pick, and
the panel can serve itself over HTTPS.

### Fixed
- **A server card never showed its own tunnel port.** The field was declared,
  documented, and never once assigned, so every card printed a dash where the
  port belongs — the one number on a card that cannot be found anywhere else on
  the page.
- **The menu would not close when you clicked away from it.** Its backdrop asked
  to cover the viewport and covered only the header, because the header carries
  a backdrop-filter and a filtered element becomes the containing block for
  anything positioned against the viewport inside it. Nothing about the CSS
  looked wrong. The menu and its backdrop live outside the header now, which
  also fixes the full-width sheet on phones — mispositioned by the same trap,
  and not previously noticed.
- **A connection limit leaked a slot on every timeout.** A forwarded connection
  that waited more than three seconds to be paired was closed without releasing
  the slot it took on accept; only the handler frees that, and the handler never
  runs for a connection that timed out. Tunnels with `max_connections` set would
  fill up permanently. Tunnels with no limit were never affected.

### Added
- **Pick the accent colour.** Six of them — Ember (the CLI's own, and the
  default), Pomegranate, Saffron, Pistachio, Turquoise and Frost — in Settings
  beside Language. Every coloured thing in the panel derives from one variable,
  so a theme is that variable and nothing else, and the login screen follows the
  same choice: it is the first thing anyone sees, and a sign-in page in a colour
  the panel does not use reads as a different product.
- **HTTPS for the web panel**, under Web Panel → Certificate in the CLI. A
  self-signed certificate works anywhere, including on the bare IP most of these
  panels live on, and the browser warns once. With a domain that resolves here
  and port 80 reachable, Let's Encrypt issues one browsers trust and renews it
  on its own — the certificate is resolved per handshake, so a reissue lands
  without restarting the panel. Off by default, and it stays off on upgrade:
  turning it on changes the address people have bookmarked, so it is a
  deliberate act rather than something an update does to you.
- **GitHub, with its star count**, in the menu. Fetched by the browser so it
  works from a panel on a server with no internet of its own, cached for six
  hours because GitHub allows sixty anonymous requests an hour, and simply left
  off when it cannot be had.
- A prompt asking for a star, shown at most once every three days, never on a
  first visit, and never again after either answer. This panel also carries the
  alerts, and anything that teaches people to dismiss it without reading costs
  more than a star is worth.

### Changed
- **The header carries the brand and the way in, and nothing else.** Uptime,
  the addresses, OS, location and ISP all moved into the menu: they are read
  when a server is set up and then almost never again, which does not earn a
  permanent strip across the top of every screen.
- **The tile row went from eight to four**: download, upload, one total, and the
  running version. In and out were two tiles answering half a question each —
  "how much has this machine moved" is the question, so it is one figure now.
  Load and the tunnel count were already on screen elsewhere, and the congestion
  algorithm is a setup detail, so it joined the rest of the machine's facts in
  the menu.
- **A tunnel's status is a ring around its whole card**, drawn inside the edge,
  instead of a bar down one side. The same three pixels, now describing the card
  they belong to, breathing on the status dot's rhythm — identical duration and
  identical keyframes, so the two read as one signal rather than two things
  blinking near each other.
- **Traffic on a card is one line** — `↓ 203.5 GiB  ↑ 13.0 GiB  Σ 216.6 GiB` —
  with the glyphs quiet and the figures bright. Dropping the label and the
  pairing slash bought the total, which is what most people were adding up in
  their head.
- Support Backpack left the menu. The heart button already floats in the corner
  of every screen, and asking twice is not asking better.

### Notes
No config, wire protocol, or tunnel behaviour changes. Updating replaces the
binary.

## v1.6.1 — 2026-07-27

A hotfix. Tunnels updated to v1.6.0 came up, held a good ping, and then carried
nothing: sites and applications would not open through them.

### Fixed
- **Forwarded connections stopped carrying data.** v1.6.0 added a zero-copy path
  to the forwarded relay — between two ordinary sockets, the kernel moved the
  bytes itself instead of them passing through this process. It is reverted. The
  relay is byte-for-byte the loop the upstream project uses, which is the
  behaviour proven on real tunnels; the optimisation was worth CPU on the plain
  TCP transport and nothing else, and it was the only place the forwarded data
  path had diverged. The traffic counting that existed only to serve it is gone
  with it, back to counting each read and write.

  Speed is unaffected: the ceiling is set by the mux stream window and the KCP
  window, which this never touched. Every performance preset behaves exactly as
  it did.
- **A connection limit leaked a slot on every timeout.** A forwarded connection
  that waited more than three seconds for a tunnel connection to pair with was
  closed without releasing the slot it took when it was accepted — only the
  handler frees that, and the handler never runs for a connection that timed
  out. On a tunnel with `max_connections` set, the limit filled up permanently
  until it would accept nothing at all. Tunnels with no limit configured were
  never affected, because the limiter does not count at all when it is unlimited.

### Notes
No config, wire protocol, or tunnel behaviour changes. Updating replaces the
binary.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-07-27

A release about being told the truth. The panel now says what it actually
knows — which language you read in, whether BBR is really in effect, what the
connection pool is doing and why — and four things that quietly lied or quietly
span are fixed.

### Fixed
- **A datagram tunnel stayed green after its client was stopped.** Stopping a
  KCP or UDP tunnel from the far end left the Iran panel showing it online,
  while the peer address and the ping both disappeared — the two halves of the
  same card disagreeing. They came from different places: the peer is written
  by the transport, which knew, and the state came from the socket table, which
  cannot know. A UDP listener is one unconnected socket that keeps no record of
  who is talking to it, so the check answered "do not restart this" and the
  panel read it as "a peer is connected". Those are two different questions and
  now have two different answers: the watchdog keeps its own, and the panel
  reads the peer the transport records. Not knowing is still kept distinct from
  knowing nobody is there, so a tunnel that has only just started is not shown
  as down before it has written anything.
- **The reconnect loop could spin without pausing.** Two of the control-channel
  dialer's error paths — the token write and the read deadline after it —
  returned to the top of the loop without waiting. Both sit *after* a
  successful dial, so they were reached exactly when a server accepts a
  connection and then drops it: a route filtered mid-handshake, a stateful
  firewall closing a half-open connection, a tunnel service restarting on the
  other side. In that state the client redialled as fast as the kernel would
  open sockets — pegged CPU, a flood of connections that looks like a scan, and
  a log filling at the same rate. Every retry now backs off, and a test walks
  all six transports to keep it that way.
- **The bot's own relay was listed among your forwarded ports.** The mapping the
  Telegram bot adds for itself appeared in the panel as
  `127.0.0.1:28583=api.telegram.org:443`, reading like something you had
  configured and could tidy away — and tidying it away stopped the bot for a
  reason that looked unrelated to the bot. The panel had its own idea of what a
  relay mapping looks like, and it knew only the oldest of the three shapes.
  There is one definition now, and the relay has its own small section showing
  just the port.
- **Data races in the restart path of every server transport.** Restart rebuilt
  a run's context and channels while goroutines from the previous run were
  still reading those same fields. Each run now carries its own state from the
  moment it starts, so a goroutine that outlives its run keeps what it began
  with instead of reaching into the run that replaced it. The race detector is
  clean across the suite.
- The header menu opened *behind* the tunnel cards. Its z-index was never the
  problem — the header makes its own stacking context, so the number only ever
  ranked things inside it.

### Added
- **Persian, throughout.** The panel and the Telegram bot can both be read in
  Persian, chosen separately: the person reading the bot is not always the
  person reading the panel. Choosing Persian flips the layout right to left,
  and Latin runs — addresses, ports, tokens, log lines — are pinned
  left-to-right inside it, because `127.0.0.1:8080` reordered on screen is
  worse than untranslated text. Anything not yet translated falls back to
  English rather than to a blank. Nothing is downloaded: the panel uses the
  reader's own system fonts, so it looks the same on a server with no internet.
- **The panel says whether BBR actually took effect.** Every socket asks the
  kernel for BBR and ignores the answer, because a kernel without it should not
  cost anyone a connection — but that means the request can quietly do nothing,
  on a tunnel whose presets were tuned expecting it. The answer is read back and
  shown, and says plainly when the kernel does not have it.
- **What the connection pool is doing.** The pool is allowed to grow past the
  size configured for it, which from outside is indistinguishable from a leak.
  The details panel now shows the live count against the configured one, and the
  throughput that grew it.
- **A visible notice when a release is out**, with the version you are on, and
  the fact that updating replaces only the binary — tunnels and configs are
  kept. The Telegram bot announces it too, once per version.
- The built-in proxy appears in the panel when it is enabled, and says so when
  it is enabled but not running — a tunnel forwarding a port to a dead proxy
  looks healthy from every other angle while refusing every connection.

### Changed
- **The header carries three facts instead of six**, and the row of unlabelled
  icons became one labelled menu. OS, location and ISP moved into it: they are
  read once when a server is set up and essentially never again.
- **Settings is five collapsed groups instead of eight flat sections**, one open
  at a time. The panel port and the panel password are one group now — both
  answer "how do I get into this panel" and used to sit at opposite ends of the
  list — and restore points moved under Update, which is what makes them.
- **The panel is responsive.** It had no breakpoints at all; on a phone the menu
  is now a sheet across the top rather than a dropdown opening below the fold.
- **The plain TCP transport relays without copying through user space** where it
  can — between two ordinary sockets the kernel moves the bytes itself. Traffic
  is still counted while it flows rather than at the end, and a bandwidth cap
  keeps the old path, because a capped connection has to be paced.

### Notes
Nothing in this release changes a config file, the wire protocol, or the
behaviour of a tunnel that already exists. Updating replaces the binary.

## v1.5.5 — 2026-07-23

A monitoring release: the web panel grows from a live snapshot into something
that remembers, and two bugs that made a KCP tunnel look broken are fixed.

### Fixed
- **Real client IP over KCP dropped every forwarded connection.** With the
  real-client-IP option on, the server prepends a PROXY protocol v2 header to
  each connection — and to build it, the code cast the *outbound* tunnel
  connection to a TCP address. On the datagram transports that connection is a
  UDP socket, so the cast failed, the header was never written, and the
  connection was closed before a byte moved. The tunnel connected, the control
  channel came up, and then nothing crossed it — the log filled with
  `destination connection address is not a TCP address`. The header now takes
  its destination from the forwarded listener the client actually connected to,
  which is a TCP address on every transport, so KCP (and raw UDP) carry the
  real client IP like the rest. There is an end-to-end test exercising the
  PROXY header over every transport that supports it, which is the coverage
  that was missing when the bug shipped.
- **KCP and UDP client tunnels showed as offline in the panel, with no ping.**
  The panel probed a client tunnel by opening a TCP connection to the server's
  port. A KCP or UDP server listens on a *UDP* port, so that probe always
  failed — and the panel then marked a working tunnel offline and showed no
  latency. The datagram transports are now judged by the same socket check the
  watchdog uses (never by a TCP probe), and their latency comes from a
  best-effort ICMP ping that can be blank without ever implying the tunnel is
  down.

### Added
- **The panel remembers now.** A per-tunnel **sparkline** shows the last few
  minutes of throughput on each card, and **Details** carries the longer view:
  a 24-hour speed chart, per-day totals for the week, and an **uptime
  percentage** for the last day and week. The history is sampled every five
  minutes by the monitoring service and kept for a month, so it survives a
  panel restart — the sparkline answers "what is happening now", this answers
  "what happened this week".
- **Health Check in the panel** (the bell-and-graph button): the same screen as
  the CLI's Health Check — server tuning, the monitor service, the panel, and
  every tunnel — with a ✓ / ! / ✗ and a plain-language fix per item, read-only.
- **Link Test in the panel** (**Details → Link Test**): measures latency, jitter
  and packet loss to the server over TCP and recommends a transport, the same
  as the CLI. It runs on a client tunnel, where there is a server to measure.
- **Alerts view** (the bell): what the monitoring service has fired — the
  conditions active right now and the recent messages, the same source as the
  Telegram alerts. A dot on the bell marks a live alert. Alerts are now recorded
  even when the Telegram bot is not configured, and the watchdog writes a line
  here every time it restarts a dropped tunnel.
- **Fuller tunnel Details.** Traffic in and out, uptime, performance preset,
  per-tunnel limits, the certificate (self-signed or Let's Encrypt, with its
  expiry), PROXY protocol, and the failover/backup addresses — all read from
  the tunnel's own config and metrics.
- **The panel warns when the monitor is down**, and shows a notice when a newer
  release is out — both from the background check, so nothing on the display
  path waits on the network.
- **Prometheus metrics** at `/metrics` (system, per-tunnel traffic and state,
  and the KCP link-quality counters), reachable with a read-only access token
  minted under **Settings → Remote access** — for anyone running Grafana across
  several servers.
- **Weekly automatic backup**, taken by the monitoring service into the standard
  backups folder and pruned like a manual one — **Settings → Backup**.
- **Restore points are listed in the panel** (**Settings**), read-only; a
  rollback stays a CLI decision because it replaces the running binary.
- **Login hardening.** Five failed logins from one address earn a ten-minute
  lockout; an optional **two-factor step** sends a code through the Telegram bot
  after the password; an optional **login alert** messages you on every sign-in
  with the address; and **Settings** lists signed-in devices with a per-device
  revoke and "sign out everywhere".
- **The panel is installable as an app** (a web manifest and icon), so it can be
  added to a phone's home screen — the usual way this dashboard gets checked.
- **Release channel and log tools in the panel**: switch stable/beta under
  **Settings → Update**, and filter the log drawer with ERROR/WARN lines
  highlighted.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **New transport: TCP + Stealth.** A TCP tunnel wrapped in an encrypted record layer
  (Noise, NNpsk0) that has **no handshake to fingerprint** — on the wire it is
  two short bursts of what looks like random data, followed by an encrypted
  stream that looks the same. There is no TLS ClientHello and no recognisable
  protocol for deep packet inspection to match against, which is the failure
  mode the TLS-based transports are increasingly hitting on filtered routes.

  The pre-shared key is derived from the tunnel token, so the transport needs no
  key of its own, and because that key is mixed in from the very first message,
  a peer without the token cannot produce a message the server will accept: it
  is dropped with no reply, so a probe or a port scan finds a dead port rather
  than a service to fingerprint. It carries TCP like the plain transport — PROXY
  protocol, per-tunnel limits and metrics all apply — with slightly more CPU for
  the encryption. Pick it under **Setup → Stealth**, or switch an existing tunnel
  to it from **Edit**. Reach for it where filtering is heavy; TCP Mux or WSS
  remain the lighter choice on an open route.
- **WSS and WSS Mux now send a browser TLS fingerprint.** A WSS tunnel is meant
  to look like ordinary HTTPS, and at the HTTP layer it already did — a real
  User-Agent, a plausible path. But the TLS ClientHello underneath was Go's, and
  Go's ClientHello has a fingerprint of its own (its cipher list, its curves, the
  order of its extensions) that filtering can pick out even when everything above
  looks right. The handshake now carries the fingerprint of a current Chrome
  build instead, so it blends into ordinary browser traffic. Nothing above TLS
  changes, and trust is unchanged — the certificate is still not verified,
  because the tunnel authenticates with its token. It applies automatically to
  every wss/wssmux tunnel; there is nothing to configure. (Where **Stealth**
  looks like nothing, this looks like a browser.)
- **New transport: UDP + KCP** — a reliable, retransmitting protocol inside UDP
  datagrams, with **forward error correction**: for every 10 packets it sends 3
  (or 4) parity packets, so losses are repaired instantly instead of waiting a
  full round trip for a retransmit. This is the transport to use when the route
  loses packets and TCP keeps backing off. Datagrams are encrypted with a key
  derived from the tunnel token.

  KCP runs over UDP. **If your provider filters UDP it will not help** — test
  before committing to it.
- **Real client IP (PROXY protocol v2).** The service behind the tunnel normally
  sees every connection as coming from the tunnel itself, so a VPN panel counts
  all users as one device and per-user device limits stop working. Turning this
  on prefixes each forwarded connection with a PROXY protocol v2 header carrying
  the user's real IP and port. Available on TCP, TCP Mux, KCP, WS Mux and WSS Mux
  (the plain websocket and raw UDP transports have nowhere to put it). **Off by
  default, and the backend must be set to accept it first** — otherwise it reads
  the header as traffic and every connection breaks.
- **Performance presets: Balance, Turbo and Aggressive**, applied to every
  transport instead of the old yes/no "Best Performance" question.
  - **Balance** — light on CPU and RAM, for a small or shared VPS.
  - **Turbo** — the recommended default. **It is byte-for-byte identical to the
    old Best Performance preset**, so upgrading changes nothing about an
    existing tunnel.
  - **Aggressive** — maximum throughput and noticeably more CPU.

  A tunnel's preset can be changed later from **Edit → Change performance
  preset**. Configs written before this release carry no preset field and are
  left exactly as they are.
- **Link Test** (**Manage → Link Test**): measures latency, jitter and packet
  loss to the far server over TCP (never ICMP — many networks on this route drop
  ping while carrying tunnel traffic fine), then **recommends a transport** and
  explains why: KCP when the link loses packets, TCP Mux when it is jittery or
  clean, WSS when nothing answers at all. It also derives **liveness timers**
  from the measured round trip instead of the fixed 75s/40s defaults, and offers
  to apply them.
- **Load balancing across backup addresses.** Previously the backup addresses
  were only spares. With balancing on, the tunnel's data connections are spread
  over all of them at once, so a single throttled route slows only its own share
  of the traffic. The control channel stays pinned to one address, since it is
  what identifies the peer. **Every address must reach the same server** — a
  second IP of it, another of its ports, or a CDN edge in front of it.
- **Setup menus are grouped by transport family** — TCP, UDP and WebSocket —
  so the choice is made in two short steps instead of one long list.

- **Per-tunnel limits.** A cap on simultaneous forwarded connections and a cap
  on total throughput, for when several services or customers share one link and
  none of them should be able to take all of it. Both off by default —
  **Edit → Limits**.
- **Structured JSON logging** (`log_format = "json"`), for anyone feeding these
  logs to a collector or a script. The default stays human-readable, since the
  usual reader is a person running `journalctl`.
- **You get told when a new version is out.** The CLI shows a line under the
  logo — and marks the Update entry — as soon as a newer release exists, and the
  Telegram bot messages you once per version.

  The check runs in the background and its answer is cached on disk, so nothing
  on the display path ever waits for GitHub: the menu cannot stall on a redraw,
  which matters on a route where the request may fail over through several
  mirrors first. A failed check leaves the previous answer in place rather than
  erasing it. The "already announced" mark is stored on disk too, so restarting
  the panel does not re-announce a version you have already been told about, and
  the notice clears itself once the update is applied. Switch it off under
  **Telegram Bot → Alerts**.
- **Telegram alerts.** The bot no longer only answers when asked — it messages
  you on its own when the processor, memory or disk crosses a threshold, and
  when a tunnel goes down or comes back. Every alert has a matching recovery
  message, because knowing a problem started is only half of it.

  Two things keep it from becoming noise, which is what makes people mute a
  monitoring bot and then miss the outage that mattered. A reading has to fall
  clearly below its threshold before the alert clears, so a value hovering on
  the line produces one message rather than dozens; and a condition that
  persists is repeated at most once per cooldown. The first pass after a restart
  only records tunnel state instead of announcing all of it.

  Defaults: processor 85%, memory 85%, disk 90%, tunnel up/down on, checked
  every 60s, repeated at most every 30 minutes. Existing installs get these on
  upgrade — a bot that never warns you is the thing being fixed — and all of it
  is editable under **Telegram Bot → Alerts**, where 0 turns a threshold off.
  Alerts are watched by the backpack-monitor service (see below), which runs
  independently of the web panel.
- **The Telegram bot reports much more.** Alongside Status it now has **System**
  (processor, memory, disk, swap, load and uptime, with bars), **Tunnels**
  (per-tunnel state, including whether the peer is really connected rather than
  just whether systemd is happy), **Metrics** (traffic, packet loss and FEC
  repairs) and **Alerts**. Everything is reachable both as a button and as a
  command — `/status`, `/system`, `/tunnels`, `/metrics`, `/alerts`, `/webui`,
  `/help` — and the two share one implementation, so they cannot drift apart.
- **Let's Encrypt certificates for wss and wssmux** (**Edit → Certificate**).
  Self-signed stays the default, because it works on a bare IP and most setups
  have no domain.

  The reason to want a real one is not encryption — the client is Backpack's own
  code and does not verify the certificate either way. It is how the connection
  looks from outside: genuine HTTPS on port 443 is never self-signed, so a
  self-signed certificate is a distinguishing mark on a route where being
  distinguishable is the whole problem. A real one removes it, and a CDN in
  front of the tunnel requires one.

  Validation works over the tunnel's own listener when it is on port 443
  (TLS-ALPN), so usually nothing extra needs opening; otherwise an HTTP-01
  responder runs on port 80. Renewal is automatic and needs no restart — the
  listener asks for the current certificate per handshake rather than holding
  the one it started with. The CLI checks that the domain resolves to this
  server before saving, so a typo is caught while the old certificate is still
  in place rather than after a restart.
- **Tunnel Metrics** (**Manage → Tunnel Metrics**): traffic and connection
  counts per tunnel, and for KCP the numbers that actually explain a slow link —
  retransmits, lost and duplicated segments, and **how many packets forward
  error correction repaired**. That last one is the direct answer to "is KCP
  earning its overhead on my route?"
- **Release channels.** The updater can follow **stable** (default) or **beta**,
  so pre-releases can be tested without being pushed to everyone. Switch under
  **Update → Release channel**.
- **Downloaded releases are checksum-verified.** The installer and the updater
  both check the asset's SHA-256 against the published `SHA256SUMS` before
  installing it, and **refuse to install anything they cannot verify** — see
  *Security* below.
- **The Telegram bot picks its own way out, and re-picks it when that breaks.**
  Reaching Telegram from Iran means going out through a tunnel, and choosing
  which one was a question you should never have been asked. The relay is set to
  **Automatic** by default: the bot forwards through whichever tunnel is up, and
  when that tunnel goes down it moves to the next live one on its own. A specific
  tunnel can still be pinned if you want one.
- **Relay diagnosis** (**Telegram Bot → Diagnose**). When the bot cannot reach
  Telegram, the error it surfaces is whatever the HTTP client saw — usually a
  bare `EOF` — and that names the wrong machine. The chain has five links across
  two servers. This walks them in order — bot configured, relay tunnel chosen,
  that tunnel up, relay port open, the peer's own internet, Telegram itself —
  and stops at the first one that is actually wrong. When something other than
  Telegram answers on the relay port, it reads the reply and **says what that
  was** (an HTTP server, an SSH server, a stale SOCKS proxy, or nothing at all)
  instead of reporting a failed handshake.
- **Backup import and export from the web panel** (**Settings**), alongside the
  CLI. Configs can be pulled down and pushed back without SSH.
- **Telegram setup from the web panel** (**Settings**) — token, admin ID, alert
  thresholds and relay choice, all previously CLI-only.
- **Setup checks the address you give it.** Before saving a client tunnel it
  resolves the server address and warns about the two things that silently break
  a tunnel that looks correctly configured: an address that resolves into a
  **CDN** (matched against published IP ranges, not reverse DNS — Cloudflare's
  addresses carry no PTR record naming it), and a domain carrying **both an A
  and an AAAA record**, where the tunnel may connect over IPv6 and fail if IPv6
  does not reach the server or the port is only open for IPv4. That second one
  is the reason a bare IP can work where its own domain does not.

### Changed
- **Monitoring is now its own service, independent of the web panel.** The
  watchdog, the Telegram bot and the alerts used to run inside the panel
  process, which made the panel a dependency of monitoring — backwards. Stopping
  the panel, or the panel crashing, or turning it off because you only wanted
  the CLI, silently stopped dropped tunnels being restarted and stopped every
  alert. Nothing visibly broke; it just quietly stopped watching, which is the
  worst way for a monitor to fail.

  They now run as `backpack-monitor.service`, which depends on nothing but the
  machine being up and restarts itself if it dies. Existing installs pick it up
  automatically — the CLI installs it on launch and the updater installs it as
  part of an update — so there is nothing to do by hand. **Health Check** reports
  on it, and says plainly that dropped tunnels will not be restarted if it is
  down.
- **The web panel now has one fixed theme, matching the CLI.** The accent is the
  same red-orange used by the menu, and the colour picker is gone — the panel and
  the terminal should look like one product rather than two. The CPU, RAM, disk
  and swap gauges follow that accent instead of a green-amber-red scale;
  **green now means exactly one thing, a tunnel that is up**, with amber for one
  that is down. Load is still readable at a glance: a gauge past 85% brightens
  rather than changing colour. An accent saved by an older build is cleared on
  first load, so an upgraded install does not keep a colour the panel no longer
  offers.
- **The panel's tunnel cards were cut back to what you actually read.** State is
  a single dot rather than a word, ports are split into **Tunnel Port** and
  **Forwarded Ports** instead of one undifferentiated list, and the country flag
  is derived from the peer's address rather than being something to configure.
  Sign out moved to the bottom of **Settings**, and Support is pinned to the
  bottom-right corner so it stays put while the page scrolls.
- **The Telegram bot's messages were rewritten.** **Status** leads with the
  things that answer "is it working" — flag, preset, ports, traffic — **System**
  was cut to the numbers worth reading on a phone, and the Tunnels and Metrics
  sections were removed rather than kept as walls of text. `/help` lists what the
  bot can actually do, and a **Backup** button pulls the configs down through
  Telegram. Internal plumbing — the relay port, the SOCKS port, the API host —
  no longer appears anywhere in a message.
- Building from source now requires **Go 1.24 or newer**; the installer checks
  for this and installs a suitable toolchain if needed. Installing from a
  release asset is unaffected — it is a prebuilt binary.

### Security
- **WSS/WSS Mux now serve a decoy website to anything that is not a tunnel.** A
  WSS tunnel is meant to be indistinguishable from an ordinary HTTPS site, but
  answering a browser, a scanner or an active probe with a `401` or a blank close
  gives it away. Every request that is not a genuine tunnel connection — a
  WebSocket upgrade, on a tunnel path, with a valid credential — is now answered
  with a plausible "Welcome to nginx!" page (`200`, `Server: nginx`), so the
  server looks like a normal website. Built in and always on; nothing to
  configure. Combined with the Let's Encrypt certificate and the Chrome TLS
  fingerprint, the server presents as a real HTTPS website to anyone probing it.
- **The WSS credential is bound to the TLS session instead of being sent.** WSS
  and WSS Mux dial with the certificate unverified — the tunnel trusts its token,
  not a CA, and the certificate is often self-signed. That is fine against a
  passive observer but leaves a gap against an active one: on a path the operator
  does not control, something can present its own certificate, terminate the TLS,
  and read the bearer token the client sends next — which is all an impostor
  needs. So the token is no longer sent. Each side derives RFC 5705 keying
  material from its own side of the TLS session, and the client proves it holds
  the token by sending `HMAC(token, keying material)`. A man in the middle that
  terminated the TLS has a different session with each side, so the proof it
  received from the client does not match what the server expects, and it never
  learns the token to forge one. It works the same for self-signed and Let's
  Encrypt certificates, and costs nothing on the wire. **Both ends of a
  wss/wssmux tunnel must be on this version.**
- **The Telegram relay port now listens on loopback only.** The bot reaches
  Telegram by having a server tunnel forward a local port straight to
  `api.telegram.org:443`. That mapping was written as a bare port number, which
  binds every interface — so the port was reachable from the internet on the
  Iran server's public address, and nothing authenticates a forwarded connection
  (the tunnel token guards the tunnel's own channel, not the ports it exposes).
  Anyone who found the port had a free, unauthenticated TCP relay to Telegram
  going out through the peer's IP. The port is only a random number in a
  40 000-wide range, which a port scan finds in seconds, and the mapping is
  hidden from every port listing, so nobody was going to spot it.

  New tunnels bind `127.0.0.1`. **Existing tunnels are migrated automatically**
  the next time the bot resolves its relay — the mapping is rewritten and the
  tunnel restarted — because it is not visible for you to fix by hand.
- **Updates now refuse to install an archive they cannot verify.** The checksum
  published with a release was checked when it was available and skipped with a
  warning when it was not, and the warning was discarded entirely by the web
  panel. Since the binary is replaced and run as root, an unverifiable download
  is now an error instead: the update stops and points at the offline install.
- **Third-party GitHub proxies were removed from downloads and updates.** The
  archive and its `SHA256SUMS` travelled through the same proxy, so a proxy
  serving a modified binary could serve a matching checksum with it — the
  verification proved nothing in exactly the situation that made a proxy get
  used. Downloads now go direct to GitHub or through the tunnel relay, both of
  which terminate TLS at GitHub. A server that can reach neither installs
  offline; the README has the steps, including a by-hand sequence for anyone who
  would rather not run a script.

### Fixed
- **The updater could not find its own tunnel relay.** It looked for the relay
  mapping by the fixed port 1080, but the port has been derived from the tunnel
  token since it stopped colliding with whatever else was already on 1080. No
  mapping written since then matched, so the relay was never offered and the
  updater was left with a direct connection to GitHub — precisely what a server
  in Iran does not have. Both forms are now recognised.
- **Traffic counts read zero on every transport except KCP.** Tunnel Metrics
  showed real numbers for KCP and nothing at all for TCP, TCP Mux, WebSocket and
  the rest. KCP was the only one being counted, and not by Backpack — the KCP
  library keeps its own counters, so those numbers arrived for free while nobody
  had ever counted the others. Bytes are now counted on every transport.
- **Traffic totals reset to zero whenever a tunnel restarted.** They lived only
  in memory, so a restart, an update or a reboot wiped the history. They are now
  written to disk and **survive a backup restore**: restoring picks up from the
  totals in the backup rather than starting again from zero.
- **The web panel now reports what an update actually did.** It fired the update
  off and reloaded after a fixed delay, discarding the log and any error, so a
  refused or failed update left you looking at the old version with nothing
  explaining why. It now follows the update and shows the outcome.
- **The web panel showed working KCP and UDP tunnels as offline.** It decided
  whether a tunnel was up by looking for connected peers in the TCP socket
  table, which is right for the TCP-based transports and meaningless for the
  datagram ones: a KCP listener is a single unconnected UDP socket that keeps no
  record of who is talking to it, so there was never anything to find. The
  tunnel was carrying traffic the whole time.

  The watchdog already handled this correctly. The panel got it wrong because it
  was answering the same question with its own separate code — so both now go
  through one function, and the panel cannot drift away from it again.
- **"connection refused" now says what to do about it.** When the far side
  cannot reach the service it forwards to, the log used to read
  `local dialer: dial tcp <nil>->127.0.0.1:4545: connect: connection refused` —
  accurate, and almost useless. It does not say which of the two machines the
  fault is on, that the tunnel itself worked, or what to check. The reasonable
  conclusion is that the tunnel is broken, and the reasonable next step is to
  uninstall it.

  It now names the machine, says plainly that the tunnel delivered the
  connection, gives the two causes that actually produce it (the service is not
  running, or it is bound to a public IP rather than 127.0.0.1), and prints the
  command that tells them apart. Timeouts get their own wording, since a
  firewall is a different problem from a missing service. Repeats are suppressed
  for 30 seconds per address: a client retrying once a second used to bury
  everything else in the log.
- **Setup now shows what the far side must be listening on.** The port mapping
  is entered on the Iran server but describes something on the kharej one, and
  that indirection is where it goes wrong. After entering the ports, setup
  prints each one resolved — `443 → 127.0.0.1:443` — so a bare port is concrete
  before the tunnel is built rather than a mystery afterwards.
- **pprof listened on every interface.** When the profiling endpoint was
  enabled in a tunnel config it bound `0.0.0.0`, unauthenticated — and a pprof
  heap dump contains whatever is in memory, including the tunnel token, which is
  all an attacker needs to connect. It is now bound to loopback; reach it with
  `ssh -L 6060:127.0.0.1:6060`. It is off by default and the CLI never enables
  it, so an install that has not hand-edited a config was never exposed.
- **Config files could be read while half written.** Backpack runs as several
  processes and they share these files: the CLI writes them, the panel and the
  monitor read them on a timer. A plain write truncates first, so a reader
  landing in that window saw an empty file — read as "the bot is not
  configured", which for the monitor is a cycle with no alerts. They are now
  written to a temporary file and renamed into place, which is atomic.
- **An update left the monitor running the old binary.** The service unit does
  not change between versions, only the binary it points at, so the
  install-if-missing check correctly found nothing to do — and `systemctl start`
  does nothing to a service that is already running. The update and rollback
  paths now restart it explicitly, and the post-update health check judges it,
  so a version whose monitor cannot start is rolled back instead of kept.
- **A SOCKS5 reply was parsed without checking for a short read.** The bound
  address at the end of the handshake was consumed with the error discarded. It
  never failed there; it failed afterwards, when the caller read the leftover
  bytes as the start of its own response — a Telegram request returning garbage
  rather than an honest connection error.
- **A data race on the control channel, in every transport.** The field was
  written by the handshake goroutine and read by the accept loop, the heartbeat
  and the restart path with no synchronisation, so a reader could observe a
  stale or half-published value — the accept loop refusing connections it should
  have allowed. On the client side `Restart()` replaced the context, the control
  channel, the usage monitor and the counters while the previous generation's
  goroutines were still reading them. Both are now published behind a lock, and
  the race detector runs on every CI build.
- **A possible crash when a peer disconnected mid-check.** The "suspicious
  packet" check asked whether a control channel existed and then asked for its
  address as two separate steps; if it was cleared in between, the address came
  back nil and the type assertion panicked. The address is now read once, and
  compared in a way that is correct for IPv6.
- **IPv6 addresses were built by string concatenation** in three places (the
  server bind address, the client's server address, and the CDN edge address),
  which produces something unresolvable for an IPv6 literal. All now use
  `net.JoinHostPort`. There are end-to-end tests running whole tunnels over IPv6.
- **The watchdog could not see UDP-based tunnels.** It read only the TCP socket
  table, so a UDP tunnel never registered as connected. Client tunnels are now
  checked against connected UDP sockets; for a server, a UDP listener genuinely
  cannot report its peers, so the health screen says that plainly instead of
  implying the tunnel is down.
- **Health Check no longer reports a false failure on UDP transports.** A TCP
  connect cannot test a UDP port, so that check now says so rather than showing
  a ✗ for a working tunnel.

### Notes
- **QUIC was built, tested on a real Iran route, and removed.** It never
  completed a handshake there while KCP on the same link worked at full speed,
  so it was dropped rather than shipped as an option that looks available and
  silently fails. The UDP menu offers UDP and UDP + KCP.
- **Compression was considered and deliberately left out.** Almost everything
  these tunnels carry is already encrypted (VPN or TLS traffic), which does not
  compress — enabling it would burn CPU for no gain while appearing to be a
  speed feature.


## v1.4.0 — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Automatic failover to backup server addresses.** A client tunnel can hold a
  list of extra server addresses (a second IP, a different port, a CDN edge).
  When the main address stops answering — a filtered IP, a blocked port — the
  client rotates to the next one automatically until something connects, and all
  data connections follow it. Set it during **Setup Client** or later from
  **Manage → Manage Tunnels → Edit → Backup server addresses**.
- **Safe updates with automatic rollback.** Every update first saves a **restore
  point** (the binary plus every config), installs the release, then health-checks
  the panel and all tunnels. If anything fails to come back up it restores the
  previous version by itself. Restore points are also listed under
  **Update → Restore points** so you can roll back on demand.
- **Safe edits.** Changing a port, address or transport keeps the previous config,
  verifies the tunnel actually came back up, and **reverts automatically** if it
  did not — reporting the reason from the log (e.g. "address already in use").
  A bad edit can no longer leave a dead tunnel and a lost config behind.
- **Change transport on an existing tunnel** (tcp ↔ tcpmux ↔ udp ↔ ws ↔ wss ↔
  wsmux ↔ wssmux) without recreating it: the name, token and forwarded ports stay
  as they are, mux settings are filled in, and a TLS certificate is generated
  automatically when switching to wss/wssmux.
- **Health Check** (**Manage → Health Check**): one screen that checks the server
  (BBR, queue discipline, socket buffers, open-file limit, binary, root, systemd),
  the web panel (service, port, firewall hint) and every tunnel (state, listening
  port, port syntax, real TCP reachability, TLS certificate expiry, token
  strength) — with a ✓ / ! / ✗ per item and a plain-language fix for each problem.
- **File Locations** (**Manage → File Locations**): every config, service, backup
  and certificate path with a ✓/✗ so you can see what is installed and where.

### Changed
- Reachability is measured over **TCP, never ICMP** — networks that drop ping no
  longer look "offline" when the tunnel port works fine.
- Backups are pruned to the newest 10 archives, and restore points to the newest
  5, so neither can fill the disk.



## v1.3.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Edit tunnel ports from the CLI.** Every tunnel now has an **Edit** action
  (Manage → Manage Tunnels → tunnel → Edit): change the **tunnel (control)
  port**, the **forwarded ports** (server) or the **server address** (client).
  Changes rewrite the config and restart the tunnel automatically; the hidden
  Telegram/SOCKS relay mapping is preserved.
- **Change the web-panel port** from the CLI (Web Panel → Change panel port)
  and from the panel itself (Settings → Panel port, with auto-redirect).
- **Release-based install & updates.** `install.sh` now installs the prebuilt
  `backpack_linux_amd64.tar.gz` / `backpack_linux_arm64.tar.gz` release assets
  into **`/root/BackPack`**, and the in-app **Update** detects newer versions
  from GitHub releases and installs them — trying **direct → tunnel SOCKS relay
  → public mirrors**, so it works from Iran without Go or git on the server.
  Works for old clone-based installs too: run Update once from ≤ v1.2.0 (final
  git pull + rebuild) and every update after that comes from the releases.
- **Backups folder.** Backups now live in **`/root/BackPack/backups`** by
  default, and Restore lists the archives there so you just pick one.
- Port entries are **validated** before they reach a config (`443`, `400-450`,
  `443=1.1.1.1:443`, …) — a bad entry used to crash-loop the tunnel service.
  Tunnel names are validated too.

### Changed
- **CLI restyled and reorganized.** Three-color theme (red / white / gray),
  a gray description beside **every** menu option, and a cleaner layout:
  Setup Server, Setup Client, Manage (tunnels · status · restart all · auto
  refresh), Backup & Restore, Web Panel, Optimize, Telegram Bot, Update,
  Uninstall, Exit. The big status header is gone — the panel link & login code
  now live inside the **Web Panel** section.
- **The web panel is monitoring-only** (recommended on the IRAN server): live
  system metrics, tunnel state/ping/logs. Tunnel creation/management, Telegram,
  auto-refresh and backup moved to the CLI; Settings keeps theme, update,
  panel port and password. Support stays.
- **Telegram bot defaults to the tunnel relay.** Configuration now asks which
  tunnel to relay through (a random SOCKS5 relay port is added to it), since
  Iran servers can't reach Telegram directly; “direct” remains available for
  kharej-side setups.
- Watchdog client health-check now matches the peer IP (not just the port), so
  an unrelated outbound connection can no longer mask a dropped tunnel.

### Removed
- Web-panel tunnel create/edit/actions, Telegram setup, auto-refresh and
  backup/restore endpoints (moved to the CLI).
- The `prerequisite/` offline bundle (release assets replaced it).



## v1.2.0 — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Full backup & restore.** Bundle every tunnel (with its token), the web-panel
  password, Telegram settings, TLS certificates, per-tunnel metadata and the
  auto-refresh schedule into a single portable `.tar.gz` — from the CLI
  (**Backup & Restore**) or the web panel (**Settings → Backup &
  restore**) — and restore it on any server. Restore re-registers and starts
  every tunnel, brings the panel back up, and restores the schedule. The archive
  extractor is hardened against path traversal, and the machine-specific
  `install_path` is never overwritten on the target host.

### Changed
- **Friendlier CLI.** The main menu now shows a short description beside each
  option, and the header shows the web-panel URL, login code, tunnel counts,
  auto-refresh status and the version at a glance.
- **Web panel starts on launch.** The panel is brought up as soon as the menu
  opens, instead of only after the first tunnel is created.

### Security
- **Tokens are no longer written to logs.** Invalid-token handshakes previously
  logged the token value (visible via `journalctl` and the panel log drawer);
  the value is now redacted on both the server and client sides.

### Notes
- No new dependencies — the binary still builds from the Go standard library
  plus the existing modules, so one-click updates keep working on restricted
  (e.g. Iran) networks.
