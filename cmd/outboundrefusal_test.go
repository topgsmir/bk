// Every transport whose data leaves by something other than the TCP dialer has
// to be on the refusal list, or its outbound settings are accepted and ignored.
//
// pck was not. It shares its case in client.go with kcp and xdi — all three end
// up in KcpConfig, which has no Outbound field — so a pck tunnel with a proxy,
// a local_addr, an interface or an so_mark passed the check, had "the tunnel
// server will be reached ..." written into its own log, and then dialled by
// whatever route the kernel chose. On a multi-homed host that is the tunnel
// leaving by the wrong uplink while the operator has been told it does not.
//
// The table is exhaustive on purpose: a new transport added without a decision
// here fails this test rather than silently joining the wrong half.
