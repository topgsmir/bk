// mux_streambuffer to tune a slow tunnel changes nothing whatsoever, and has no
// way to find that out: the setting is accepted, reported back by the panel,
// and silently ignored by the library. Tuning that appears to work and does not
// is worse than tuning that is refused.
//
// Only a pinned 1 is worth warning about. On auto the version is settled with
// the server, and the answer is 2 whenever both ends are new enough to be
// asked — so the setting will be applied unless the peer is too old, which is
// reported on the control channel instead.
