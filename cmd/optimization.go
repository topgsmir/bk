// ApplyTCPTuning applies the socket and TCP settings a tunnel wants, at start.
//
// It used to carry its own table of values, and that table disagreed with the
// one Optimize writes. The disagreements were not visible from anywhere:
// Optimize set net.core.rmem_default to 16 MB and the next tunnel start put it
// back to 1 MB, the same for wmem_default, and tcp_notsent_lowat went from
// 128 KB to 32 KB the same way. An operator who had deliberately optimized the
// machine had three of those settings quietly undone by a restart.
//
// ip_local_port_range was the fourth and the one that was visible, because
// losing a service's port is a thing people notice. It is the reason this now
// takes its values from optimize.EngineStartupTuning rather than keeping a
// second copy of them — one table means the two cannot drift, and which keys a
// starting tunnel may set is decided there, beside the values.
