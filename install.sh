# trusted_dir <dir> — true when an arbitrary local account cannot put a file in it.

# it fetched: the local release asset below, and the source-build fallback. Both
# install or compile something that then runs as root, and both take whatever
# happens to be sitting in the script's own directory.
#
# Which directory that is depends on how the script was started. The documented
# forms are all fine — `bash <(curl ...)` resolves to /dev/fd and a plain pipe
# to /, neither of which holds an asset; the documented offline path puts all
# three files in /root; a clone in a home directory is writable only by the
# person running sudo. What is not fine is the natural variation on the offline
# path: scp install.sh to /tmp and run it there.
#
# /tmp is world-writable, and its sticky bit does not help with this. Sticky
# stops one account deleting or replacing another's file, so the scp'd
# install.sh is safe — but it does nothing about CREATING a file that is not
# there yet. An account on the box pre-creates bk_linux_<arch>.tar.gz and
# waits, and the branch below prefers a local asset over the download.
