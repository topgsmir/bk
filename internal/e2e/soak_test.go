// What happens at hour two.
//
// The suite proves correctness over seconds: `-race` and a three-minute
// end-to-end run. Both leaks this codebase has had are invisible at that
// timescale and obvious at a week —
//
//   - pooled connection slots bleeding on a pairing timeout, so a tunnel with
//     max_connections eventually refused everything with a limit that looked
//     correct in the config;
//   - a sixty-second timer allocated for every forwarded UDP packet and held
//     for its full duration, which at a thousand packets a second is sixty
//     thousand live timers for one direction of one flow.
//
// Both were found by reading the code, months after they were written. Neither
// would have survived two hours of traffic and a goroutine graph.
//
// So: real traffic, sustained, with the process watched. The shape that matters
// is many short connections rather than one long transfer, because that is what
// exercises the per-connection accounting where both leaks lived — a single
// long download allocates its buffers once and tells you nothing.
//
// Off by default. BK_SOAK_SECONDS is what turns it on, so the ordinary
// suite stays fast and CI can give it a couple of minutes without anybody
// waiting on a laptop.
