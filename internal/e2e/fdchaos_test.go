// Running out of file descriptors, for real.
//
// This is the third of the faults in chaos_test.go and the one that cannot be
// simulated: the interesting part is that *every* syscall that needs a
// descriptor fails at once — accept, dial, open — while everything already open
// keeps working perfectly. A stub listener returning EMFILE tests the accept
// loop's backoff, which internal/utils/acceptloop already does. It does not test
// what a tunnel does.
//
// The limit is process-wide, so lowering it inside the ordinary test binary
// would break whatever else that binary is doing. The test therefore re-runs
// itself as a child process, lowers the limit there, and reports what the child
// found. That is also closer to the real thing: a VPS with a low `nofile` is
// one where the limit was low before the tunnel started.
//
// What it holds:
//
//   - the process does not die, and does not spin;
//   - a caller that arrives while there are no descriptors gets an error rather
//     than a connection that hangs for ever;
//   - when descriptors are free again, the tunnel carries traffic without
//     anybody restarting it.
