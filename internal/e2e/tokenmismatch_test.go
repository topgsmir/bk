// A refused handshake has to say why it was refused.
//
// This is the failure a report arrived with: tunnels that would not come up,
// and a log insisting the far server was out of date and should be upgraded.
// The server was fine — the two ends had different tokens.
//
// The server refused by closing the connection, which reaches the client as
// "failed to read message length from net.Conn: EOF". So does a server too old
// to understand the signal. So does a server that has already given its control
// channel to somebody else. Three faults, one symptom, and the client named the
// one that was least likely and most expensive to act on.
//
// The giveaway was in the report's own log: the client fell back to the older
// handshake and went on getting EOF, which an actually-old server would have
// answered. Nothing in the code was reading that.
//
// This drives the real server with a hand-written client, because what is on
// trial is what the server puts on the wire.
