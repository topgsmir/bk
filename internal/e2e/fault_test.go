// Widening lossyRelay from "drops a share" into a path that misbehaves the way
// real ones do.
//
// The relay already existed and already proved its worth: without it KCP and
// plain UDP look identical on a clean loopback, and a change that silently
// disabled forward error correction would pass every other test. It does one
// thing, though — throw datagrams away — and three tests use it.
//
// Loss is not the failure these tunnels actually meet. The networks bk
// runs on add delay, vary that delay packet by packet, and deliver out of
// order; a shaper that buffers and releases in bursts produces all three at
// once. Those are the conditions the transports claim to survive, and nothing
// checked that claim.
//
// Rather than a second relay, the existing one learns to be slow and
// disordered as well as lossy. The setters are additive and default to zero, so
// every test already using it is unaffected.

// SetLatency adds a fixed one-way delay to every datagram, in both directions.
func (r *lossyRelay) SetLatency(d time.Duration) { r.latency.Store(int64(d)) }

//
// Jitter is what produces reordering, and deliberately so: a datagram held 40ms
// behind one held 5ms arrives second having been sent first. Simulating
// reordering as its own knob would be modelling the symptom rather than the
// cause.
