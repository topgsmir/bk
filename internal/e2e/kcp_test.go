// The kcp re-adopt path had the fix but no coverage, while udp and quic both
// had a test for theirs. These close that gap. They run on kcp rather than xdi
// because xdi needs a raw ICMP socket (root) — it is the same transport code
// with a different packet layer, so kcp stands in for it here.

// kcpTestSettings are the session knobs a stand-in client must dial with. Both
// ends have to agree: the FEC shards are not negotiated, and the token doubles
// as the AES key, so a mismatch means the server cannot decode the packets at
// all and the test would pass for the wrong reason.

// TestKCPServerReadoptsRestartedClient is the re-adopt assertion: a client that
// restarts on its own — a crash, a service restart, an edit — must get its
// tunnel back without anyone touching the server.
//
// The point is that the server cannot notice the old client left. KCP carries
// no RST, the control-channel read blocks with no deadline, and a heartbeat
// write to a silent peer is buffered rather than refused — so the dead session
// stays "established" for this run and the only thing that ever arrives is the
// new client's claim. Before the fix that claim was discarded as a duplicate
// and the tunnel stayed dead until the server was restarted by hand.
//
// Two things this test does deliberately, because without either of them it
// passes against the broken server as well:
//
//   - The old client is cut off through a relay before it stops, not simply
//     stopped. A clean shutdown sends SG_Closed on the control channel, which
//     the server acts on by restarting — recovery that owes nothing to re-adopt.
//   - The restart is a real client, not a synthetic claim. A stand-in claim that
//     gets discarded leaves the live control channel untouched, so the tunnel
//     keeps working either way.
