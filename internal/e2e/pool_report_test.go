// grown pool and a leaking one look identical: a count of open sockets, larger
// than the number in the config. The panel can only tell them apart if the
// client says what it was aiming for and what it was carrying.
//
// Everything up to here is unit-tested in pieces. This is the join: a real
// tunnel, reported by the transport that maintains the pool, arriving in the
// snapshot the panel reads. It is the part that silently does nothing if the
// report is never called — which is exactly what a unit test cannot catch.
