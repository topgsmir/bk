// A server that stays up while its client comes and goes does not accumulate
// anything — on either side of the process.
//
// Every client that leaves ends one of the server's generations, and the next
// client starts another in the same process — the lifecycle ADR 0001 describes.
// A generation that leaves a goroutine or a descriptor behind is invisible for
// days and then is the reason a server that has been up for a month runs out of
// file descriptors. So the same server serves eight clients in turn, each one
// carrying traffic before it goes, and what the process holds afterwards is
// compared with what it held after the first.
//
// udp is not here: its forwarded ports are UDP, and this churns a TCP user
// through each client.
//
// Deliberately not parallel: it counts the whole process's goroutines, and Go
// runs every sequential test before any parallel one starts.
