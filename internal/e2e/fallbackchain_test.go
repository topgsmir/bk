// The transport fallback chain, end to end.
//
// This is the product's headline claim — a tunnel that keeps working when the
// path changes — and until now the engine would not do it: a tunnel pinned to a
// filtered transport retried that transport for ever and the operator was the
// failover mechanism.
//
// The tests below use the strongest available form of "this carrier is
// blocked": the other end is not speaking it at all. A client dialling quic at
// a server that only listens for tcp cannot complete a handshake no matter how
// long it waits, which is exactly the shape of a filtered carrier and needs no
// packet filter to arrange.

// The client is configured for a transport the server does not speak, with a
// fallback to one it does. The tunnel must come up on the fallback and carry
// data — without anyone touching it.

// It also proves the thing that makes the design safe on the server: a
// candidate has to let go of the forwarded ports before the next one binds
// them, or the second candidate fails to start and the tunnel never recovers.
