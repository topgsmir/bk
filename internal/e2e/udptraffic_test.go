// The udp transport carried traffic and reported none of it.
//
// TestTrafficIsCountedOnEveryTransport says "every transport" and lists six,
// and udp is not among them — it cannot be, because that test forwards a TCP
// echo backend through the shared harness and udp needs a datagram path on both
// ends. So the one transport with no coverage was the one transport with no
// counters, and it stayed that way through every release: neither CountedConn
// nor AddBytes appeared in either of its files, because it never hands out a
// net.Conn for the wrapper to go around.
//
// What that looked like from outside was not a missing feature. It was a tunnel
// carrying gigabytes and reading 0 B in, 0 B out in the panel, in the CLI, in
// the Telegram report and on the traffic chart — an idle tunnel, as far as
// anything that displays it could tell.
