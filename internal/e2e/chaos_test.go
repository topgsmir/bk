// Faults that are not network faults.
//
// fault_test.go covers the path: loss, latency, jitter, a backend that accepts
// and then says nothing. Those are the conditions a tunnel is designed for, and
// they are not the conditions that take one down. The three below are what
// actually happens to a VPS, and none of them had a test:
//
//   - a process is killed while it is carrying traffic, which is what an OOM
//     kill, a `systemctl restart` under load and a panic all look like from the
//     other end;
//   - the disk fills, so every write the engine makes fails at once;
//   - the file descriptors run out, so accept and dial both fail while
//     everything already open keeps working.
//
// What they assert is the same in each case: the tunnel does not wedge, and it
// comes back without anybody touching it. A tunnel that dies loudly is a tunnel
// systemd restarts; a tunnel that survives in a state where it carries nothing
// is the failure worth testing for.

// openFDs counts this process's open file descriptors. Linux only; used to tell
// "recovered" from "recovered while leaking a connection every time".

}

// The far end is killed with bytes in flight.
//
// Stopping a client between transfers is the easy case and TestServerRestartRecovery
// already covers the server side of it. This is the one that leaves state
// behind: a pool connection mid-frame, a mux stream half written, a forwarded
// connection with a read outstanding. The server has to notice, let go of all
// of it, and be ready for the replacement.
//
// Three cycles rather than one, with the descriptor count checked across them,
// because the interesting failure is not a crash — it is the tunnel coming back
// every time while keeping something from each previous life.
