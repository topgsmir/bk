// Package alerthist keeps a small on-disk record of what the alert watcher has
// fired: the conditions active right now and the most recent messages.
//
// The watcher lives in the backpack-monitor process and the web panel in its
// own; a JSON file is the same decoupling the tunnel metrics already use. The
// monitor writes, everyone else reads, and a missing file simply means nothing
// has ever fired.
