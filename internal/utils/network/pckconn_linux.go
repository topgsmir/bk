// A net.PacketConn that carries the tunnel's KCP datagrams inside TCP segments
// this process builds and reads itself — the "pck" transport.
//
// Every other TCP-family transport opens a socket and lets the kernel's stack
// do the work. That stack is also where a filtering box's easiest levers are:
// connection tracking has an opinion about the flow, netfilter can drop it
// before any socket sees it, and the handshake it performs is the thing most
// often matched on. This carrier steps around all of it. Receive is an
// AF_PACKET socket, which taps the device driver — upstream of conntrack, of
// every netfilter chain, and of reverse-path filtering, so a rule that drops the
// tunnel's packets does not stop them arriving here. Send builds the frame and
// hands it to the same driver.
//
// What it is NOT is an IP-spoofing transport. The source address on every packet
// is this machine's real one, so the peer can answer it and the reply is routed
// normally. The only thing forged is the impression that a TCP connection exists:
// there is no handshake, no kernel state, and no stack on either side — just
// segments that look exactly like an established connection's, with KCP inside
// providing the reliability a real stack would have.
//
// Two consequences follow, and both are handled here:
//
//   - The kernel is not listening on the port these segments are addressed to,
//     so it answers each one with a RST. That would tear the flow down at any
//     stateful middlebox in between. A narrow iptables rule drops those.
//   - Conntrack would create an entry for every one of these pseudo-flows, for
//     no benefit, and on a busy server that fills the table. They are marked
//     NOTRACK.
//
// Linux only, and needs root or CAP_NET_RAW.
