// Two ways to get a certificate:
//
//   - A file pair on disk, which is the self-signed certificate bk
//     generates. This works anywhere, including on a bare IP with no domain.
//   - Let's Encrypt, when the tunnel has a real domain name pointing at it.
//
// The second is worth having for a reason that is not really about encryption:
// the client is our own code and skips verification either way. It is about
// what the connection looks like from outside. Genuine HTTPS on port 443 never
// presents a self-signed certificate, so one is a distinguishing mark on a
// route where being distinguishable is the problem. A real certificate removes
// it, and is also what a CDN in front of the tunnel requires.
