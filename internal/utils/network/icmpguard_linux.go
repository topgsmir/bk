// The icmp spoof profile carries its data inside ICMP Echo Requests. A raw
// socket lifts those out, but the host kernel ALSO sees each one — it is a real
// echo request addressed to this host's real IP — and answers it with an Echo
// Reply to the (forged) source. That reply is useless to the tunnel, and it is
// expensive: it echoes the request's payload, so on the download path it is one
// full-sized packet out for every full-sized data packet in — the uplink cost
// doubles — and a host answering pings it never sent is a plain fingerprint.
//
// The obvious silence is net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1, which the reference
// spoof-tunnel uses and this carrier used to. It works, and it is too broad: it
// is a per-namespace switch that stops the kernel answering EVERY echo request,
// including the ones that arrive on the tunnel itself. A layer-3 tunnel is a
// private network, and ping across it — health checks, path-MTU discovery,
// mtr — is a first-class thing to do; the global switch silences all of it.
// Measured on a loopback pair: with the global switch, ping across the tunnel
// is 100% loss while TCP is fine.
//
// icmpEchoGuard is the narrow version, modelled on rstGuard. It installs one
// iptables rule that drops exactly the kernel's auto-replies to THIS carrier's
// requests — outbound Echo Replies whose ICMP identifier is the tunnel's, which
// the carrier stamps as its port. A ping across the tunnel carries a different
// identifier and is untouched. The kernel still stops wasting the uplink; the
// tunnel's own ICMP still works.
//
// It matches the identifier with the u32 module, because iptables has no native
// icmp-id match. If u32 is unavailable the rule does not install, and — unlike
// the old behaviour — nothing falls back to the global switch: a tunnel that
// works and wastes some uplink is a better failure than one whose private
// network cannot carry a ping. The carrier logs which happened.

// clients draw theirs at random. What every packet of the tunnel carries is its
