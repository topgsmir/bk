// Binding the WSS credential to the TLS session.
//
// A WSS tunnel verifies nothing about the server's certificate — it dials with
// InsecureSkipVerify, because the tunnel trusts its token, not a certificate
// authority, and often the certificate is self-signed anyway. That is fine for
// confidentiality against a passive observer, but it leaves a gap against an
// active one: on a path the operator does not control, something can present its
// own certificate, terminate the TLS itself, and read whatever the client sends
// next — including the bearer token, which is all an impostor needs to become
// the client.
//
// So the token is never sent. Instead each side derives a value from the TLS
// session that only the two genuine endpoints share — RFC 5705 exported keying
// material — and the client proves it holds the token by sending
// HMAC(token, keying material). A man in the middle terminating TLS has two
// different sessions, one with each side, so its keying material does not match
// the server's; it cannot turn the proof it received from the client into the
// proof the server expects, and it never learns the token to forge one. The
// binding costs nothing on the wire — it is the same Authorization header as
// before — and works the same whether the certificate is self-signed or from
// Let's Encrypt, because it depends on the session, not the certificate.

// The proof above lets the server know the client. Nothing let the client know
// the server: whatever terminated the TLS on the path could answer the upgrade
// itself, token or no token, and then tell the client which addresses to dial
// for every connection it carried. So the server now answers each upgrade with
// a proof of its own, in a response header — HMAC(token, "server" || keying
// material), domain-separated so it can never be the client's proof reflected
// back — and the client checks it.
//
// A header, because an older client ignores headers it does not know: the
// server can be upgraded first, as the QUIC binding already asks. An older
// server sends none, and a new client cannot tell that from something on the
// path that stripped it — so it accepts a missing answer from a server it has
// never had one from, and refuses one from a server that has answered before
// (in this process). That closes the path for every tunnel whose server is up
