// Reaching the tunnel server through a local proxy.
//
// Some clients cannot open an arbitrary outbound connection at all. A machine
// on a corporate or campus network may only be allowed out through a proxy; a
// box already running a SOCKS5 listener may have that as its one working route
// out; and on a filtered path a proxy on another host is sometimes the only
// address that still answers. In every one of those cases the tunnel's own
// address is reachable and the tunnel still cannot dial it, because it insists
// on connecting directly.
//
// So the client can be told to go through a proxy, exactly as rathole's client
// can: one URL, either socks5:// or http://, with optional credentials.
//
// Only the connection to the tunnel server goes through it. The dial to the
// local backend deliberately cannot — that traffic never leaves the machine,
// and sending it out through a proxy and back would be both slower and wrong.
// The separation is structural rather than a rule to remember: this file is
// reached only from the tunnel dial paths, and the backend dial calls the plain
// TcpDialer, which has no way to take a proxy.

// ProxyConfig is a parsed proxy URL, or nil when the tunnel dials directly.

// ParseProxy turns a configured proxy URL into something dialable. An empty
// string means no proxy, which is not an error.
//
// It is strict about the scheme, because the two it understands behave
// completely differently on the wire and a typo would otherwise surface as a
// tunnel that cannot connect for no stated reason.
