// The bug this guards against cost the pck transport every tunnel it ever
// carried, and it was invisible from this side of the wire.
//
// kcp-go's listener demultiplexes sessions purely on the sender's address:
// `l.sessions[addr.String()]`. When every carrier in a client's pool sent from
// one source port, all of them reached the server as the same peer — and
// kcp-go's rule for a packet announcing a new conversation on an existing entry
// is to close the entry. Each pool connection therefore killed the session
// before it, the control channel included, and the tunnel spent its life in a
// connect/timeout/restart loop.
//
// So: carriers must take different ports, and those ports must stay inside the
// range the firewall rules are written against.
