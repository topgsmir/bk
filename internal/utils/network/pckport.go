// Which source ports the pck carrier's segments come from, and how the firewall
// rules that protect them are spelled.
//
// This is arithmetic and string building — no sockets, no syscalls, no build
// tag — for the same reason pckframe.go is: the decisions made here are the ones
// worth asserting on in a test, and a test that only runs on Linux is a test
// that mostly does not run. What needs a packet socket lives in
// pckconn_linux.go; what needs iptables lives in pckguard_linux.go.

// pckPortSpan is how many consecutive source ports one client tunnel may use:
// one per carrier, since each KCP session must reach the server as its own peer.
// The pool is configurable and allowed to grow past its configured size, so the
// range is comfortably larger than any pool anyone would run; ports wrap within
// it rather than escaping, so the guard's range always covers what is in use.
const pckPortSpan = 128

// pckPortsInUse records which ports inside the range are held by a live
// carrier, so one is never handed to two.
//
// This was an incrementing counter taken modulo the span, which is correct for
// the first pckPortSpan carriers and wrong for every one after them: the
// counter never came back down, so carrier 128 was given the same port as
// carrier 0 — and carrier 0 is the control channel, which is still on it.
//
// What that does is not subtle, and newPckConn already describes it: kcp-go
// demultiplexes on the sender's address alone, so two carriers on one port
// arrive as one peer, and a packet claiming a new conversation on an existing
// entry closes the old one. The control channel died, the client timed out and
// reconnected, and the operator saw a tunnel that dropped every so often and
// had to be restarted by hand — which worked, because a fresh process starts
// the counter at zero again.
//
// A pool dialling a connection every sixteen seconds, which is what the logs
// from the field showed, walks through the whole span in about half an hour.

// pckClientPortBase is the bottom of the client's source-port range for the

// long as any of its carriers is open, so a pool shares one range and one set of
// kernel-suppression rules. Once the last carrier closes the range is given up,
// and the next open draws a new one.
//
// It used to be derived from the token, so that a restart would find its old
// rules identical and replace them rather than pile up. That made every restart
// send the same flow — the same source port to the same destination — and that
// is what a middlebox that has stopped passing a flow keeps on dropping.
// Reported on v1.8.4: "a direct pck tunnel stops after about 24 hours, and I
// have to delete it and make it again; auto reset is on both servers." The
// restarts brought back the blocked flow; only a new tunnel, with a new token
// and so a new port, got out. Leftover rules are now found by the tunnel's tag
// instead (see pckTunnelID and sweepTunnelRules), so nothing depends on the
