// The tcp spoof profile forges TCP segments to a port the host is not listening
// on. The kernel answers each with a RST addressed to the (forged) source, which
// would tear the flow down before KCP ever sees it. rstGuard installs a single,
// targeted iptables rule that drops exactly those kernel RSTs — outbound TCP
// segments with the RST flag whose source port is the tunnel's — and removes it
// again when the tunnel closes.
//
// It is deliberately narrow: it never touches the inbound packets (our raw
// socket still reads them), and it matches only RSTs on the one port, so no
// other TCP traffic is affected. It is best effort — if iptables is missing or
// the rule cannot be installed, the tunnel still runs; the operator is warned
// that the kernel's RSTs may disrupt it.
