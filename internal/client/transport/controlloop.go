// dials a pool connection whenever the server asks for one, answers the
// server's probes, notices a server that has gone quiet, and says goodbye —
// and closes the channel — when the generation ends.
//
// All seven transports had their own copy, and the copies had drifted: only
// the KCP one had been taught not to blame the path for a timeout that the
// beat clock had already explained (#45), and every copy read and wrote
// through whatever control channel the transport held at that moment rather
// than the one its generation was started with. It is here once now, bound to
// its generation's context and channel; a transport chooses only how the
// signals travel (link, see controlwire) and whether its server expects each
// heartbeat answered.
