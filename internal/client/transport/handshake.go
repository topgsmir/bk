// The client half of the control handshake.
//
// A pool connection used to prove nothing: the server accepted it because its
// source address matched the control channel's. The client now asks for a nonce
// instead, and presents it on every pool connection — see network.PoolNonce for
// why the address was the wrong thing to judge by.
//
// Asking is a new signal rather than a flag inside the old one, which makes the
// negotiation trivial in one direction and cheap in the other. A server that
// already speaks it answers with the nonce. A server that does not never
// recognises the signal and closes the connection, and the client notices that
// and drops back to the old handshake. The cost of meeting an old server is a
// couple of failed connection attempts.

// controlAckTimeout is how long to wait for the server's answer to the
// handshake.
//
// It was two seconds, which is the kind of number that works everywhere it is
// tested and then does not: it has to cover a round trip plus whatever the
// server takes to answer, and on a long or lossy path — which is the ordinary
// case for this tunnel, not the exceptional one — a retransmitted SYN alone can
// eat most of it. There is nothing to gain from failing fast here, because
// failing means backing off and dialling again, which costs far more than
// waiting a few seconds longer would have.

// Without one, a stream transport is left relying on TCP to notice, and TCP is
// in no hurry: with the default keepalive_period of 75s the kernel sends nine
// probes 75s apart after 15s of silence, so a tunnel that died seconds after it
// came up is reported healthy for another eleven and a half minutes. The
// watchdog cannot cover for that either — the socket stays ESTABLISHED for the
// whole of it, which is the only thing the watchdog can see.
//
// The server heartbeats every heartbeat seconds and the tuner writes
// keepalive_period as twice that, so keepAlive is worth two heartbeat intervals
// here. Half again on top is what survives a single lost heartbeat: at two
// intervals exactly, one dropped heartbeat on a lossy link is enough to tear
// down a tunnel that is alive, which is the failure worth avoiding most —
// RecommendKeepAlive is built around the same rule. On the defaults this

// beatClock learns how often the server's heartbeat actually arrives, so a

// The control deadline was one and a half keepalives — 112 seconds at the
// default — because the client had no other idea how long silence could
// legitimately last. On TCP that rarely mattered: a crashed server's kernel
// answers with a reset. Over KCP and QUIC there is no kernel to answer, and a
// server that crashed or rebooted cost the tunnel the full 112 seconds,
// measured, on every one of those transports.
//
// The server says how often it beats by beating. Once three gaps have been
// seen, the deadline is three of the longest gap — two lost beats in a row
// tolerated — floored so a quick server cannot make a lossy path look dead,
// and never longer than the keepalive rule it replaces. Against a server that
// beats every forty seconds that is 120, above the old rule, so nothing
// changes; against one that beats every ten it is thirty.
//
// It is per control channel: a new one starts with a new clock, so a server
// replaced by an older, slower one is not held to the faster one's rhythm.
// Only the reader goroutine touches it.

// Learning takes three gaps, and a server that dies before they arrive used to

// warm-up of quick beats, the first a tenth of a second in; no older server
// beats sooner than a second after the channel opens (one second is the
// shortest heartbeat it accepts, and its first beat is one interval in). So a
// first beat inside warmupEvidence is proof of a server that keeps a fast
