// Reporting a failed dial to the forwarded service.
//
// This is the most common failure a user will ever hit, and for a long time it
// read:
//
//	local dialer: dial tcp <nil>->127.0.0.1:4545: connect: connection refused
//
// which is accurate and nearly useless. It does not say which machine the
// problem is on, that the tunnel itself worked, or what to do. Someone seeing
// it concludes the tunnel is broken and uninstalls, which is the worst possible
// outcome for a failure that is usually a panel listening on the wrong address.
//
// So the message names the machine, says the tunnel did its part, gives the two
// real causes, and prints the command that distinguishes them. It is also
// rate-limited: a retrying client produces one of these per connection, and
// twenty identical lines a second buries whatever else the log had to say.

// localDialReporter rate-limits the "cannot reach the local service" message,
// one line per address per interval.

// connections" indistinguishable from "refused one", and that difference is the
// whole reading — a service that is down against a client that tried once while
