// Scaling the connection pool on throughput, not only on churn.
//
// The pool grows when the server asks for new connections faster than the pool
// supplies them. That is a good signal for many short connections and blind to
// the opposite case: a few long-lived streams — one large download, a video
// call, a backup — ask for a connection once and then saturate it for minutes.
// The request counter sits near zero the whole time, so the pool never grows
// however full the pipe gets, and the tunnel stays limited to the connections
// it happened to open at the start.
//
// Throughput is the missing signal, and it is already being measured: the
// metrics collector counts every byte the tunnel carries, so reading it costs
// two atomic loads per tick.
//
// This only adds a reason to grow: the existing trigger is untouched, and a
// transport whose counters do not move never sees it fire.
