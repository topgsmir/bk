// Three different faults used to reach the operator as one symptom.
//
// The server closed the connection on a token it did not recognise, and on a
// control channel it had already given to somebody else. Both arrive at the
// client as
//
//	failed to read message length from net.Conn: EOF
//
// which is also exactly what a server too old to understand the signal
// produces. The client could not tell them apart and guessed the least likely
// of the three, so a report came in of tunnels that would not come up while the
// log insisted the far server needed upgrading — and it did not. It had the
// wrong token.
//
// The fix is that the server says which it is. These check the client can read
// that and does not mistake it for anything else.
