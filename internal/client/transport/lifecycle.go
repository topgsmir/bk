// A client runs in generations, like the server it talks to: one control
// channel and the pool and streams that serve it, sharing one context. When the
// control channel is lost the transport ends the generation and dials the next.
// The sequence was written out seven times and the copies had drifted — two of
// them left the pool figures of a connection that was gone on the panel until
// the next run's first tick. It is here once now; a transport supplies only
// what it must tear down besides the control channel, what per-generation state
// it resets, and how it starts.
