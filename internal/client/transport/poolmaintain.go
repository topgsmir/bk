// How big the connection pool should be, decided once.
//
// Every client transport keeps a pool of connections dialled ahead of the
// traffic that will use them, and every one of them had its own copy of the
// loop that sizes it. The copies were the same loop — the same two tickers, the
// same two factors, the same growth and shrink conditions — and they had
// drifted exactly the way copies do.
//
// Three of the seven were still character-for-character identical. The other
// four had each been edited at a different time, and the drift was not
// cosmetic:
//
//   - **`udp` never reported its pool at all**, so the panel's connection-pool
//     card was simply absent on a udp tunnel — not empty, not zero, missing —
//     while it appeared for every other transport.
//   - **`udp` never grew its pool on throughput either.** The load signal that
//     lets a pool grow when its connections are each working hard, rather than
//     only when somebody is waiting for one, was added to the others and not to
//     it. A udp tunnel under sustained load therefore sat at its configured
//     size while the same load grew every other transport's pool.
//   - `ws` had already been through the first of those two, and the comment
//     recording it is still in the history: the card "was simply missing on a
//     ws or wss tunnel". It was fixed there and not looked for anywhere else.
//
// That is the whole argument for one copy. The policy here is a judgement about
// when a tunnel needs more connections, and a judgement that exists seven times
// is seven judgements.
//
// # What a transport still decides
//
// How to dial one connection, and what a connection is. `dial` is the only
// thing passed in, and every difference between the transports lives behind it.

// poolSizer is everything the sizing loop needs from the transport that owns
// the pool.
//
// The counters are pointers because they belong to the transport and are
// written by its dialler and its handler, on other goroutines; this loop only
// reads and resets them.
