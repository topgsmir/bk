// Package controlwire is how a reverse tunnel's control channel carries its
// signals, for both ends.
//
// Every signal is one byte — a heartbeat, a request for a pool connection, a
// round-trip probe, a goodbye (see utils.SG_*). The stream transports send the
// byte as it is; the websocket transports send it as a one-byte binary message.
// Each end of the tunnel used to carry its own copy of both, with its own copy
// of the write bound, and a test that read the other side's source to check the
// two bounds still agreed. They are here once, so they cannot disagree.

// WriteTimeout bounds a write on the control channel.
//
// None of the signals is worth waiting on, and waiting on one is what took a
// tunnel down for a quarter of an hour at a time. A write goes into the
// kernel's send buffer and returns; when the peer stops absorbing anything the
// buffer fills and the write blocks until the kernel stops retransmitting,
// which is around fifteen minutes on Linux defaults. For that whole window the
// server believed it had a control channel — refusing the client's attempts to
// make a new one, asking nobody for pool connections, dropping every user with
// the queue full — and the client could hang a restart on a goodbye nobody was
// going to read.
//
// Ten seconds is far longer than a healthy path needs for one byte and far
// shorter than a broken one takes to admit it. Past that the channel is treated
// as gone, which is what it is.
