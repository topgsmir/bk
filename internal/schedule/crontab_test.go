// "There is no crontab" and "the crontab could not be read" are not the same
// answer, and treating them as one is how installing a job deletes every other
// job on the machine.
//
// readCrontab returned nil for every failure of `crontab -l`, and SetCron built
// the new crontab from that nil — which is a crontab containing exactly one
// line, ours. So a transient failure turned "schedule an auto-refresh" into
// "replace this machine's crontab with a single bk entry": the operator's
// backups, their certificate renewals, their own scripts, gone, and the program
// reporting success.
//
// The distinction is made on what cron says. Every implementation in use
// answers a user with no crontab with those words.
