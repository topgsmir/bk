// How a job that panicked is brought back.
//
// Containing a panic per job was already right: without it a bug in the
// Telegram bot would take the watchdog down with it, and tunnels would stop
// being restarted for a reason that has nothing to do with tunnels.
//
// What was missing is what happens next. The failed job stopped for the life of
// the process, and the only trace was one line in a log nobody is reading at
// the time. If that job is the watchdog, self-healing is silently off from then
// on — which is the worst thing this service can do quietly, because the whole
// point of it is to be the thing that notices.
//
// So a panicking job is restarted, with a backoff so that one panicking in a
// tight loop does not become the new problem, and with a ceiling so that a job
// which cannot run at all is eventually left down and said so once, rather than
// restarted every five minutes for ever. The announcement goes into the alert
// history as well as the log, because a log line is not a notification.
const (
	// jobRestartFirst and jobRestartMax bound the backoff. Seconds rather than
	// milliseconds: what is being waited for is a bug clearing on its own,
	// which it usually will not — the delay is there to keep the log and the
	// processor usable while that becomes apparent.
	// jobRestartLimit is how many times one job is brought back before it is
	// left alone. A job that has panicked this many times is not going to
	// succeed on the next attempt.
