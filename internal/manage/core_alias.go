// The lowest layer of this package now lives in internal/manage/core: the
// tunnel listing, the systemd operations and the few helpers both rest on.
//
// It was lifted out because everything here sits on it and it sits on nothing,
// which makes it the one seam in a 28,000-line package that can be cut without
// untangling anything first. What it buys is not tidiness: a change to how a
// unit is written stops being a change to the package the panel, the CLI and
// the monitor all import wholesale.
//
// The names are re-exported here on purpose. `manage.List`, `manage.Tunnel`
// and `manage.RestartService` are called from six packages and from the CLI,
// and a split that moved them would be a split that touched every caller — so
// the public surface is exactly what it was, and the seam is internal.

// Tunnel is a discovered tunnel derived from a config file on disk.
