// Which tunnels have their other end on a managed server.
//
// A tunnel built across a node is one tunnel in two places, and the panel has
// to keep knowing that after the form is closed. Without it the second half of
// the feature cannot exist: an edit here would change this end and leave the
// far one on the configuration it was created with, which is the exact
// disagreement the whole thing was built to prevent.
//
// It lives in this package rather than in internal/node — which is where the
// fleet itself is kept — for two reasons. That package already imports this
// one, so putting it there and reading it from here would be a cycle. And the
// CLI needs to read it: a tunnel edited from the menu cannot push anything,
// because the channel to the node belongs to the running panel process, so the
// least the menu can do is say so rather than quietly breaking the pair.
//
// It is a record of where a tunnel's twin is, not a claim that it is reachable.
// Nothing here talks to anything.

// NodePairPath is the file. It is not secret — it holds names — but it is
// written with the same permissions as its neighbours.
