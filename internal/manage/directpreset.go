// Presets for a direct tunnel.
//
// The reverse presets set a dozen fields — pool size, heartbeat, channel size,
// socket buffers, KCP windows — most of which a direct tunnel simply does not
// have. It keeps no connection pool, sends no heartbeat and runs no KCP; one
// mux session carries everything.
//
// So these are their own thing, and deliberately small. What actually decides
// how a direct tunnel feels is the mux flow control: how much data one stream
// may have in flight before it has to wait for the far end. That is the number
// that caps a single download, and the default is modest enough to be the
// limit long before the link is.
//
// The names match the reverse presets so the same word means the same ambition
// on either kind, even though the fields behind them differ.

// directPreset is one named set of tuning.

// The stream buffer is the headline number in each. At 100 ms round trip, a
// single connection can move roughly StreamBuffer / RTT — so 256 KB is about
// 20 Mbit/s, 2 MB about 160, and 16 MB more than the link. Anyone whose single
// download feels slow while the link is fast is being limited by this and
// wants the next one up.
