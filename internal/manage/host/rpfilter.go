// rpFilterSysctlFile persists the relaxation so it survives a reboot, alongside

// OfferRelaxRPFilter checks whether reverse-path filtering will drop this
// machine's forged-source packets and, if it will, offers to relax it — the one
// piece of host setup a spoof tunnel needs that the tunnel cannot do for itself.
//
// It is offered rather than done silently because it changes a kernel security
// setting: rp_filter is what stops a machine accepting packets with impossible
// source addresses, and loosening it is a real decision, even though a spoof
// tunnel cannot receive without it. The operator sees exactly what will change
// and says yes.
//
// It sets 2 (loose), not 0 (off): loose still drops a source reachable via no
// interface at all, so it keeps most of the protection while letting a forged
// source that the default route covers through — which on a server with a
// default route is every useful one. If the tester later shows a source still
// not passing, 0 is the fallback, and the message says so.
//
// peerReal is the peer's real address, used to find the receiving interface
// when none was pinned; iface, if set, is spoof_interface.
