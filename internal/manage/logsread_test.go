// asked for a line holding a control character with no terminal attached,
// prints "[63B blob data]" in its place unless it is given --all. That is
// systemd up to 254, which is what Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 run: every line in
// the panel's Logs dialog was a blob while the same journal in the CLI (a
// terminal) read fine. So the read asks for everything, and the colour codes
// are taken out before the text leaves this package.
