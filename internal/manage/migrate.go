// What an update forces onto a server that an older version set up.
//
// A fix that changes only what a new install writes reaches nobody. The servers
// that need it most are the ones that have been running longest, and those are
// exactly the ones nothing rewrites: the config was written once at setup, the
// sysctl file was written once by Optimize, and every release after that
// replaces the binary and leaves both precisely as they were.
//
// ip_local_port_range is the case that made this necessary. The engine widened
// it to "1024 65535" on every start, which put every service port on the box
// inside the range the kernel hands out as the source port of an outgoing
// connection — and a port held that way cannot be bound by the service that
// owns it. Removing that line fixes it for nobody who already has it: the value
// is live in a running kernel, and the only thing that ever mentioned it was a
// health check somebody had to think to run.
//
// So an update corrects the machine as well as the binary, and it does so
// without asking. That is deliberate, and it is the whole point — these are
// corrections to values this program itself wrote and later decided were wrong,
// and a setting the operator never chose is not one they should have to choose
// again. It is also the limit. A migration that would overwrite a real decision
// does not belong here, and each one below says in its own words how it tells
// the two apart.
//
// Everything here is idempotent and runs on every update rather than once. A
// marker file recording "already applied" would be wrong in both directions: a
// config restored from an older backup would be skipped because the marker was
// set by a different file, and a value an operator forced back by hand would
// stay forced back. Running every time and writing only when something is
// actually different is simpler and more correct than remembering.
//
// This runs after the new binary is in place and before the tunnels are
// restarted, so they come back up on the corrected settings rather than inherit
// the old ones until something else happens to bounce them.

// configFile is one tunnel's configuration, as a migration sees it. A migration
// may change the body, the mode, or both; the pass writes back only what
// actually changed.
