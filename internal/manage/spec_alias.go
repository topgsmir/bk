// The names are re-declared here under exactly the names they had, the same way
// core_alias.go re-exports internal/manage/core. Sixty-two files in this
// package call them and six packages call into this one, so a move that renamed
// anything would be a move that touched all of them — and a refactor whose diff
// is every call site is a refactor nobody can review.
