// The setup link, from the operator's side.
//
// Everything below this was already built: the codec, the mirror that turns one
// side's settings into the other's, the validation, and error messages written
// for somebody holding a pasted string — "copy it again, all of it", "paste the
// setup link from the other server". All of it was reachable from nothing. The
// panel encoded a link and decoded it again in the same process as a way to
// derive a peer's config, and that was its only caller.
//
// So there was nowhere to get a link and nowhere to paste one, which is the
// whole feature missing while every part of it existed.
//
// It matters more than a convenience. A tunnel has around thirty paired
// settings, and the failure a mismatch produces is the most expensive one this
// system has: the tunnel comes up, reports itself connected, and carries
// nothing. Reading two files side by side is how that mismatch happens. A link
// is how it stops.

// showShareLink prints a tunnel's setup link for the operator to carry to the
// other server.
