// help and do not always work. What always works is a browser somewhere else,
// a file, and scp.
//
// So: put bk_linux_<arch>.tar.gz in /root, choose this, and everything
// after the download is exactly what the online update does — the same
// verification when a checksum is there, the same snapshot before anything is
// touched, the same health check afterwards, and the same automatic rollback
// when a tunnel does not come back. Nothing about the risky half is special
