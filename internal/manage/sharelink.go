// Handing a tunnel's settings to the other server.
//
// Everything in a tunnel is paired. The token, the transport, the port, the
// packet profile, Stealth, the error-correction scheme, the socket count — the
// codebase says "both ends must match" sixty times, and it says it because a
// pair that does not match produces the worst failure this system has: the
// tunnel comes up, reports itself connected, and carries nothing. Nobody is
// told, because from each end's own point of view everything is fine.
//
// The panel's answer used to be a list of four values with a Copy button each,
// and an instruction to type them in again over there. That works for four
// values and stops working the moment a carrier has six more — which is exactly
// when getting one wrong costs the most.
//
// A share link is those settings in one string. The side that was set up first
// produces it; the other side pastes it into its own form, which fills in and
// is then reviewed and submitted like any other. Nothing is executed: it is a
// form filler, not a command.
//
// # What it is not
//
// It is not encrypted, and it should not be described as if it were. Like the
// vmess links it is modelled on, it is a compressed, encoded payload that
// anybody holding it can read — and it carries the token, which is the whole
// credential. A link pasted into a group chat is a tunnel somebody else can
// join. The panel says that next to the button; this package will not pretend
// otherwise.
