// It used to extract straight into the live config directory, one entry at a
// time, as the archive was read. Every way an archive can turn out to be bad
// is found part-way through reading it — a truncated stream, a gzip checksum
// that only fails at the very end, a path that tries to escape, a read error
// on the upload — and by then some of the tunnels had been overwritten and
// some had not. The installation was left in a state that came from neither
// the backup nor from what was there before, with nothing to put it back.
//
// So the whole post-restore tree is now built in a staging directory first:
// the current configuration copied in, the archive laid over the top, every
// entry checked before it is written, and the compressed stream read through
// to its checksum. Only then does anything in the live directory change, and
// the change is one rename. If any part of that fails, the live directory has
// not been touched at all.
