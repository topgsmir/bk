// Getting a backup off the machine it describes.
//
// The backups are thorough and they are written to /var/backups on the server
// they were taken from. The case they exist for — the machine died, the
// provider suspended it, somebody rebuilt it — is precisely the case where they
// are on the machine that is gone. A backup that only survives what it was
// never needed for is not a backup.
//
// # Why a command rather than an S3 client
//
// The obvious design is an S3 uploader, and it is the wrong one here. It means
// credentials on the box, a dependency, and a provider list that is never
// complete — and the operators this is for already have something that works:
// rsync over SSH to a machine they own, rclone to whatever they use, scp to a
// laptop. A command is the interface they already have, and it is the one that
// does not need a release to support a new destination.
//
// So the setting is a command line with one placeholder. Everything else is
// theirs.
//
//	offsite = "rclone copy {} remote:backpack/"
//	offsite = "scp {} backup@10.0.0.9:/srv/backpack/"
//	offsite = "restic backup {}"
//
// # What it deliberately does not do
//
// It does not run as a shell. The command is split on whitespace and executed
// directly, so a destination from a config file cannot become a pipeline, a
// redirect, or `; rm -rf /`. An operator who genuinely wants a shell writes
// `sh -c '...'` and has made that decision visibly.

// offsiteFile holds the command. Beside the other per-machine settings rather
// than in a tunnel's config: it describes this server, not a tunnel.
