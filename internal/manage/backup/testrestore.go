// Proving a backup would restore, without restoring it.
//
// The recovery procedure is written down and it has never been run. That is the
// ordinary state of a disaster-recovery plan and it is the reason they fail:
// the first time anybody exercises it is the day it has to work, on a machine
// that is already gone, with whatever the backup turned out not to contain.
//
// This runs the real staging path — the same tar reader, the same name
// validation, the same size limits, the same sidecar parsing — against a
// throwaway directory, and then throws the result away. Everything the real
// restore would refuse, this refuses. Everything it would silently do without,
// this reports.
//
// It deliberately does not commit. A drill that changes the machine is not a
// drill anybody runs on a working server, and one nobody runs proves nothing.

// RestoreReport is what a backup turned out to contain.
