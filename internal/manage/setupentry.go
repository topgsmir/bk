// The two ways into setup.
//
// The menu used to offer "Setup Server" and "Setup Client". Those names were
// already a little confusing — in a reverse tunnel the Iran machine is the
// server — and with a direct tunnel they become actively wrong, because there
// the Iran machine is the one that dials. A name that means the opposite of
// what it says is worse than a name nobody recognises.
//
// So the entries are geographic, which is the thing that does not change with
// the direction: Iran exposes the ports either way, kharej holds the real
// service either way. Only who reaches out first differs, and that is asked
// rather than encoded in the name.
//
// The order is deliberate. An operator always knows which machine they are
// sitting on; they may not yet know which direction they need. Asking the
// certain question first means the uncertain one arrives with the two options
// described side by side, at the moment it can be answered.
//
// # What this does not do
//
// It dispatches. SetupServer and SetupClient are called unchanged, so a
// reverse tunnel is built by exactly the code that has always built one — this
// adds a question in front of them and nothing else.

// SetupIran is the entry point for the Iran server: the machine users connect
// to, which exposes the forwarded ports in both directions.
