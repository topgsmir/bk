// Restarting everything onto a new binary, from wherever the request came.
//
// An update can be started from the SSH menu, from the web panel and from the
// Telegram bot. The last two run inside units the update itself restarts — the
// panel in backpack-webui, the bot in backpack-monitor — and `systemctl
// restart` of the unit that contains the caller stops the caller: systemd sends
// every process of the unit SIGTERM and waits for it. The update used to
// restart the panel first, then the monitor, then the tunnels, then check them
// and roll back if they failed; started from the panel it died at the first
// step, and the tunnels, the health check and the rollback never happened.
//
// So the order is fixed here, once, for the update, the local update and the
// rollback alike: tunnels first, then the monitor and the panel — and whichever
// of those hosts the caller is not restarted here at all. It is recorded, and
// the caller restarts it with FinishDeferredRestarts once it has reported the
// outcome — the report is the last thing it can do, since the restart ends it.
//
// What that costs: a panel or monitor that fails to start on the new binary is
// not caught by the update's own health check, because it is started after it.
// systemd's Restart= keeps retrying it, and the SSH menu remains the way in.
