// The monitor service.
//
// Watching the tunnels, running the Telegram bot and sending alerts used to
// happen inside the web-panel process. That made the panel a dependency of
// monitoring, which is backwards: stopping the panel — or the panel crashing,
// or the user turning it off because they only wanted the CLI — silently
// stopped the watchdog restarting dropped tunnels and stopped every alert. The
// failure was invisible, which is the worst property a monitor can have.
//
// It now runs as its own systemd unit that depends on nothing but the machine
// being up. This file only manages the unit; the work itself lives in
// internal/monitor, which imports this package.

// monitorUnit is the systemd unit for the monitor service.

# A crash loop has to end somewhere visible.
#
# Restart=always on its own never lets this unit reach "failed": it restarts for
# ever, so systemctl status says "activating" a few seconds out of every ten and
# an operator glancing at it sees a service that is running. With a start limit,
# a monitor that cannot stay up stops trying and says so — and the heartbeat in
# the config directory goes stale, which is what Diagnose and the panel read.
#
# Six attempts in five minutes is well past any transient cause. These belong in
# [Unit] and not [Service]: systemd moved them, and the old placement is ignored
# without a word on any version that matters.

[Service]
# notify rather than simple, so systemd knows the difference between a process
# that exists and one that is working.
#
# This unit is the right place for a watchdog and a tunnel engine is not. What
# it catches is a monitor wedged on a job that never returns — a goroutine
# deadlocked, a socket that will never answer — which systemd is otherwise
# perfectly happy with, and which looks from the outside exactly like a healthy
# service with nothing to do. The cost of being wrong is a restart of the
# watchdog; the cost of not noticing is a fleet with nothing watching it.
#
# WatchdogSec is generous on purpose: the heartbeat goes out every half of it,
# and a machine under load must not be killed for being slow.

# The tunnel units carry this too. A service does not inherit the ceiling in
# /etc/security/limits.conf — that file is PAM's, and applies to login sessions
# — so a unit that does not ask gets systemd's default of 1024, and no amount
# of running Optimize or rebooting changes it. This process holds the panel's
# own sockets, the node hub's listeners and whatever it proxies, so it needs
# the same headroom the tunnels were given.
