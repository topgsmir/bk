// The report this exists for: "the health check still says Open file limit
// 1024 — low for many connections, run Optimize then reboot — even though
// Optimize has been run and the server rebooted."
//
// Everything about that was wrong except the number.
//
//   - It measured this process. `ulimit -n` in a shell started by the panel
//     reports the panel's own ceiling, and the limit that matters is the one
//     the tunnels run under.
//   - Optimize writes /etc/security/limits.conf, which belongs to PAM and
//     applies to login sessions. A systemd service never reads it. So the
//     advice could not change the number it was complaining about, on that
//     reboot or any other.
//   - And the units for the panel, the monitor and the proxy asked for no
//     limit at all, so they really were on systemd's default of 1024.
//
// These guard the three of them.

// The limit is a property of the unit, so every unit bk installs has to
// ask for one.
