// Fetching an update through a tunnel when there is no way out directly.
//
// The updater already tries the tunnel relay after a direct connection, but it
// could only use a tunnel that already carried the mapping — the port a server
// tunnel exposes onto the peer's own SOCKS proxy. That mapping exists when the
// Telegram bot has been set up to relay through that tunnel, and otherwise it
// does not exist at all. So on the machine this matters most for — an Iran
// server with working tunnels and no route to GitHub — the updater found no
// relay and gave up, while a perfectly good way out was running the whole time.
//
// What was missing is the step the bot already takes: pick a tunnel that is up
// and add the mapping to it. That restarts the tunnel for a moment, which is
// why it is not done silently. The CLI asks first, names the tunnel, and says
// what it will cost; see runUpdate.

// RelayOption is a tunnel that could carry the download, and what using it
// would cost.

// Only server tunnels qualify: the relay works by exposing a local port that
// maps to a port on the peer, and only the server side exposes ports. Only
// online ones qualify either — a tunnel that is not carrying traffic cannot
// carry this, and offering it would turn a clear failure into a timeout.
