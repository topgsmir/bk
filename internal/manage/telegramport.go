// Reaching Telegram through a tunnel, without a proxy.
//
// The original design sent the bot through a SOCKS5 proxy running on the peer:
// the Iran server exposed a port mapped to the peer's loopback, and a proxy
// there made the outbound connection. It worked, but it needed a second moving
// part on the far machine, and when that part was missing — no monitor service,
// a port already taken — the failure surfaced as a bare "EOF" on the near side.
//
// A tunnel already forwards a port to an arbitrary destination, so it can
// simply forward to api.telegram.org:443 directly. No proxy, nothing to install
// on the peer, nothing to keep running. The bot connects to a local port and
// the bytes come out of the peer's network card.
//
// TLS is unaffected and, if anything, safer: the request is still
// https://api.telegram.org/..., so the certificate is still verified against
// that name. The tunnel carries an already-encrypted stream and cannot read it,
// which is not something a SOCKS proxy could be said to guarantee.

// telegramBindAddr keeps the forward on loopback.
//
// A mapping written as a bare port number binds every interface, which would
// put an unauthenticated TCP path to api.telegram.org on this machine's public
// address. Nothing authenticates a forwarded connection — the token guards the
// tunnel's own channel, not the ports it exposes — so anyone who found the port
// would have a free relay to Telegram egressing from the peer's IP, and the
// port is only a random number in a 40000-wide range, which a port scan finds
// in seconds. The bot runs on this host and dials 127.0.0.1, so there is no
// reason for the listener to be reachable from anywhere else.
const telegramBindAddr = "127.0.0.1"

// telegramMappingPort reads the local port out of a Telegram mapping.
//
// The mapping binds loopback, so its left side is "127.0.0.1:41234" rather than
// a bare number. Older installs wrote the bare form, and those are still read
// here: refusing to recognise them would append a second mapping on every call
// and grow the port list without bound.
