// Proving a release came from the person who publishes them.
//
// Every release carries a SHA256SUMS file, and the updater refuses to install
// an archive whose hash is not in it. That is what stops a mirror handing over
// a different binary, and it is most of the protection — but it is not all of
// it, because the list travels the same channel as the thing it describes. A
// party that can substitute the archive on one of the third-party proxies these
// machines are obliged to use can substitute the list beside it, and both then
// agree with each other.
//
// A signature does not travel that channel. It is checked against a key that
// came with the binary already running on the machine, which arrived when
// somebody installed it and has not been near a mirror since.
//
// The signature is over SHA256SUMS rather than over each archive. One file
// covers every asset, because every asset is already verified against it, and
// the signing step in CI is then one line over one file instead of a loop that
// can miss an architecture — which is how five of seven architectures once came
// to be built and not published.

// sigAssetName is the signature published beside the checksum list.
