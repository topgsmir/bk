// A restart is reported on its own, which is right for a one-off: "why did my
// tunnel reset overnight" should be answerable. It is wrong for a tunnel that
// is doing it all day. At one restart per cooldown a sick tunnel can produce
// twenty lines an hour, and twenty separate lines are indistinguishable from
// twenty unrelated events across a week — nobody reads that list and concludes
// the tunnel is flapping.
//
// Which matters because flapping is how several real faults present. A path
// that drops full-sized packets kills the session on the first real transfer
// and it reconnects; a liveness deadline set too tight tears down a tunnel that
// is merely slow. From the outside all of them look like a tunnel that mostly
// works, which is worse than one that is plainly down: nobody investigates.
//
// So repeated restarts are reported as one condition. The restarting itself
// does not change — a flapping tunnel still gets restarted, because not
// restarting it would only make it a stopped one.
