// The two questions a tunnel could not answer about itself.
//
// A tunnel that connects and then carries nothing is the hardest failure in
// this system to attribute, because every surface reports health: the service
// is running, the control channel is up, the panel shows it online. Working out
// what was actually wrong meant counting sockets by hand and sampling byte
// counters between two runs of `ss` — an afternoon of it, for a fault that the
// tunnel had all the information to describe in a sentence.
//
// Two things turned out to matter, and neither was visible anywhere:
//
//   - How much of the pool exists. A control channel with no pool behind it
//     looks exactly like a healthy tunnel until somebody tries to use it.
//   - Whether the path can carry a full-sized packet. Where it cannot, and the
//     network declines to say so with an ICMP message, TCP never finds out: the
//     small packets — the handshake, the heartbeats — arrive, so the tunnel
//     comes up and stays up, and every real transfer stalls on the first
//     full-sized segment. Nothing in the tunnel, the kernel or the panel
//     reports this. It has to be measured on purpose.
//
// Both are read-only measurements taken from the live tunnel.

// sockStat is what the kernel knows about one live tunnel connection.
