// Health defined by what a tunnel is carrying, not by whether it is running.
//
// The watchdog's question has always been "is the control channel up". The
// failure that costs an operator the most is the one that answers yes: a tunnel
// that is up, reports a peer, shows green in the panel, and moves nothing. A
// path that drops full-sized packets does this. So does a far end whose relay
// goroutines are wedged, and so does a middlebox that lets the handshake
// through and then holds the flow.
//
// # Why "no bytes" is not the test
//
// An idle tunnel moves no bytes and is perfectly healthy, and most tunnels are
// idle most of the time. A watchdog that restarted on silence would restart
// every tunnel on the host every night. Silence is not a symptom.
//
// The symptom is *asymmetry*. If a tunnel is sending and nothing at all is
// coming back — not less, none — across several checks in a row, then something
// is being sent that is not arriving or not being answered. That is unambiguous
// in a way silence never is, it cannot be produced by an idle tunnel, and it is
// exactly the shape of every failure listed above.
//
// # Why the response is graduated
//
// The engine has a control socket now, so there is a rung below restarting the
// process: ask it to restart its own transport. That keeps the process, its
// metrics history, its uptime, its accumulated counters and its log continuity,
// and it clears every stall that is about the transport rather than about the
// path — which is most of them. See internal/enginectl, and note that an engine
// too old to have a socket falls straight through to the next rung rather than
// costing the tunnel an interval.
//
// "Rebuild the pool" is still not available and is deliberately not faked: an
// op that reports success and changes nothing is worse than one that does not
// exist, because a rung that does nothing is a rung whose failure is invisible.
//
// What is also available is knowing when to stop. A stall that survives a
// restart is not a tunnel that got stuck; it is a path, an MTU or a far-end
// service, and restarting it every three minutes makes it worse while burying
// the evidence.
// So the ladder here is: notice it and say so; ask the engine to restart its
// transport; restart the process once that has not helped; and if restarting
// does not fix it, stop restarting and say what to look at.
