// The rp_filter check is the one Health Check line that catches a spoof tunnel
// which is up, connected, and carrying nothing. Its value comes from the live
// host, so what these pin is the shape: which carriers get the check, and that
// a strict reading produces a failure naming the exact fix while a relaxed one
// passes. The reading itself is exercised in the netns rig.

// Only a forged-source carrier is subject to rp_filter dropping its packets, so
// only a spoof tunnel gets the line. A udp or pck l3 tunnel must not, or the
// check is noise on every other tunnel.
