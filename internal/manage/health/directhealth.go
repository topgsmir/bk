// Is a direct tunnel up?
//
// The watchdog and the health screen both answer this from the kernel's table
// of established TCP sockets, and both used to answer it wrongly for the two
// direct kinds, because the question they ask is phrased in terms of a reverse
// tunnel: a "server" is healthy when something has connected to its bind port,
// and anything else is healthy when it has connected out to its remote.
//
// Neither describes these. A direct tunnel's Iran side dials out, so it looks
// like the reverse tunnel's client and happens to be judged correctly. Its
// kharej side listens, but is not called "server", so it fell through to the
// dial test and could never pass it — a perfectly healthy tunnel showing
// permanently offline. A layer-3 tunnel has no TCP socket at all on any of its
// carriers, so nothing in that table could ever say anything about it.
//
// The watchdog was saved from restarting them in a loop only by its rule that
// a tunnel which has never once been healthy is not treated as having dropped.
// That is a guard against exactly this mistake, not a reason to leave it.

// directHealthy reports whether one of the two direct kinds is up, and whether
// the question could be answered at all. known is false when nothing
// observable can settle it, which callers should read as "leave it alone"
// rather than "it is broken".

		// The engine can, and writes its peer down for exactly this. Reading
