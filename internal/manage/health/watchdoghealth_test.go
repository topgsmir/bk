// The watchdog has to ask the engine, not the kernel.
//
// It judged a tunnel by whether `ss` showed an ESTABLISHED socket, and a socket
// outlives the tunnel behind it by a long way: one whose keepalive probes go
// unanswered stays ESTABLISHED for about eleven minutes on the shipped
// defaults, and one stalled on a path that drops full-sized packets stays
// ESTABLISHED while it retransmits. Both were reported this week as "the tunnel
// is down and I have to restart it by hand" — which is precisely the job the
// watchdog exists to do and could not, because the only thing it looked at said
// everything was fine.
// A snapshot with no opinion must not be read as "not connected".
//
// Through an update the binary is replaced while the tunnels keep running the
// previous one, so for a few minutes the watchdog is new and the snapshots are
// old. Reading a missing field as false there would restart every tunnel on the
// host at once — the update would look like an outage.
