// The forwarder has to be able to say when its listeners are up.
//
// UDP gives a client no signal that the far side has bound, so a test that
// sends before the listener exists can only retry. The retry that was here
// looked like a twelve-second budget — sixty sends, each with a 200ms read
// deadline — and was nothing of the kind: a datagram sent to a port nothing has
// bound draws an ICMP port-unreachable back, and a connected UDP socket then
// fails its next Read *immediately* rather than waiting out the deadline.
// Measured on this machine: sixty attempts in 725µs.
//
// So on CI, where the listener goroutine had simply not been scheduled yet, the
// test gave it under a millisecond and then reported
//
//	no reply came back through the udp forwarder
//
// which reads as a forwarder that does not forward. Run took 20s, the test
// itself 0.00s — the tell, if anyone had looked at it.
//
// A guess is the wrong instrument when the answer is knowable. Run knows
// exactly when every socket is bound, so it says so.
