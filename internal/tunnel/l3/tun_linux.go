// The TUN device.
//
// Opening one is a single ioctl on /dev/net/tun, so it is done directly with
// x/sys/unix rather than through a library: the whole of the interaction is
// the twenty lines below, and pulling in a dependency for it would be a poor
// trade against this tree's one-binary, few-dependencies habit.
//
// Configuring the interface afterwards — address, MTU, link up — goes through
// the ip(8) command rather than netlink. Netlink would avoid the fork, but it
// is a great deal of code to write and get right for something that happens
// three times at startup, and this tree already shells out for iptables in the
// spoof carrier for the same reason.
//
// IFF_NO_PI is what keeps the read path simple: without it every packet
// arrives behind a four-byte protocol prefix that would have to be stripped on
// read and prepended on write. With it, what is read from the device is
// exactly an IP packet, which is exactly what the encapsulation expects.

// tunDevice is an open TUN interface.
