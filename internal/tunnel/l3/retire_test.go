// Retiring sessions, and what the management screens read from it.
//
// A layer-3 tunnel holds no socket the kernel can report on: udp is an
// unconnected socket and the raw carriers do not go through the stack at all.
// So the engine writes its peer down, and the health screen reads that. Which
// makes retiring a session not merely housekeeping — it is the only thing that
// can ever say the tunnel is down.

// tunnelWithSession builds a tunnel with a current session created at a chosen
// time, without opening anything.
