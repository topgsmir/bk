// A second, unconfirmed handshake must not move the peer a first one
// established.
//
// The l3 handshake is NNpsk0 and carries no freshness of any kind — the init
// payload holds the encapsulation and nothing else — so a recorded typeInit
// datagram stays valid for ever and the listening side cannot tell a replay
// from a first contact. handleInit used to adopt the source of any accepted
// init as the peer whenever no session was CURRENT, and retireSessions clears
// current after rejectAfterTime: five idle minutes reopened that window on
// every tunnel. One replayed datagram from a forged source then pointed this
// end's outgoing packets at an address of the attacker's choosing. They could
// not be read there — the keys need the initiator's ephemeral, which a replay
// does not carry — but they were not reaching the peer either, and the panel
// named the attacker as the connected peer.
//
// Pinning it to "no peer has ever been seen" leaves the first handshake after a
// restart working exactly as before and closes every later one. The rest is the
// protocol's to fix: a monotonic timestamp in the init payload, refused unless
// it advances, which is a wire change both ends have to agree on.
