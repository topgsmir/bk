// The forwarder.
//
// This is what gives a layer-3 tunnel the same ports = [...] interface the
// reverse tunnel has. It is intentionally the dullest code in the package: a
// listener, a dial, and bytes copied between them. Everything that makes the
// tunnel a tunnel has already happened by the time a packet from here reaches
// the interface.
//
// # Why it runs beside the tunnel rather than inside it
//
// The engine restarts on error — a carrier that could not bind, a device that
// went away — and the forwarder deliberately does not restart with it. A user
// connection to a forwarded port has no reason to be dropped because the
// tunnel resealed its session, and rebinding the listeners on every restart
// would race the ports against the generation replacing them. So the listeners
// are opened once and outlive any number of tunnel restarts. While the tunnel
// is down the dial simply fails and the connection is refused, which is both
// correct and self-healing.
