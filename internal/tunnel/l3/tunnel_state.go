// rejectAfterTime is documented as the point a session stops being usable at
// all, and for a while nothing enforced that against the current session: only
// previous and pending were ever dropped. A tunnel whose peer had gone away
// therefore held its last session forever. The data path barely noticed —
// packets sealed under keys nobody holds are dropped at the far end, if there
// still is one — but the management screens did. The peer written to the
// metrics snapshot was never cleared, so a tunnel whose far end had been down
// for hours went on showing "peer connected" on the panel, which is the exact
// failure the snapshot was added to prevent.
//
// The gap between rekeyAfterTime and rejectAfterTime — two minutes against
// five — is the window a rekey has to complete in, and it is deliberately
// generous. Reaching the far end of it means three minutes of failed
// handshakes, which is a tunnel that is down whatever the panel says.
