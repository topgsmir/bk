// The spoof carrier has two keys for one setting and used to read the wrong one.
//
// spoof_sockbuf is what the panel's Advanced form collects and what
// directrender writes; sockbuf is the [l3] table's own key, which every other
// carrier reads. openSpoof passed cfg.SockBuf, so the specific key was
// validated on the way in, written to the file, and read back into the form on
// the next visit — while the socket got the general one or the 4 MiB default.
// A setting that reads back as applied and is not is worse than one that does
// not exist, because it gets ruled out as a cause.
