// Package mssclamp caps the TCP segment size of connections crossing a tunnel
// interface.
//
// This is the fix for the one failure a tunnel interface produces that looks
// like nothing at all: ping works, SSH works, a small page loads — and every
// large transfer stalls forever.
//
// # The fault
//
// A tunnel's MTU is smaller than the MTU of the interfaces at either end,
// because the encapsulation takes its cut. A TCP connection crossing the tunnel
// does not know that. Its two endpoints negotiate a segment size from *their*
// interfaces — 1460 off an ordinary 1500-byte link — and then send full-sized
// segments that cannot fit.
//
// The kernel is supposed to learn this from an ICMP "fragmentation needed"
// message and lower its estimate. Path MTU discovery is exactly what that is
// for. But those messages are dropped by a great many networks, and dropped
// with particular enthusiasm on the routes these tunnels exist to cross. So
// nothing learns. Small packets keep arriving, which is why every liveness
// check passes, and the first full-sized segment of every download disappears.
//
// # The fix
//
// Rewrite the MSS option in the SYN of every TCP connection leaving the tunnel
// interface, so both endpoints agree on a segment size that fits before a
// single byte of data is sent. Nothing has to be discovered, so nothing depends
// on an ICMP message arriving.
//
// Both chains are needed and they cover different traffic. FORWARD is for
// packets routed *through* this host — the private-network case, where the
// tunnel joins two networks. OUTPUT is for connections that start on this host,
// which is what a forwarded port does. A rule on one chain alone leaves the
// other kind broken in exactly the way described above.
//
// # Why this is shared rather than copied
//
// Two tunnel kinds create interfaces and both need this. An earlier version of
// this code existed once per kind, which is how the pck carrier came to have
// five hundred copies of one firewall rule on a machine in the field: the add
// path and the remove path drifted. The sweep below is the part that must not
// drift, so there is one of it.
