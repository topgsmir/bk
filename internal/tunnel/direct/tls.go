// The origin's certificate for wss.
//
// Three ways to get one, in order of what the operator asked for:
//
//	acme_domain          Let's Encrypt, renewed automatically
//	tls_cert + tls_key   a certificate the operator supplies
//	neither              one generated here, in memory
//
// The third is the default because it is what a direct connection to an IP
// address wants, and it is safe for the same reason the whole design is: the
// tunnel's trust anchor is the token, proved inside the connection, over every
// transport alike. TLS here is transport and camouflage. An edge that has been
// told a `server_name` verifies the certificate against it and needs one of
// the first two; an edge that has not is talking to an address rather than a
// name, where no certificate could mean anything anyway.
//
// The generated certificate lives only in memory and a restart makes a new
// one. Nothing depends on it being stable — the edge is not pinning it — and
// keeping it out of the filesystem means one less secret on disk.

// originTLSConfig builds the server-side TLS configuration for wss.
