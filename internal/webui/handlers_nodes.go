// A node is a server that has been told, once, which panel manages it, and has
// been connecting outward to that panel ever since. From here it looks like a
// place a tunnel can be put: the fleet screen lists them, and the setup form
// can build both ends of a tunnel in one submission instead of leaving the
// operator to repeat every paired value on a second machine by hand.
//
// The panel holds no login for any of them. See internal/node.

// nodeInfoTTL is how long a server's own account of itself stands for.
//
// Short, because half of what it says — processor, memory, uptime — is a
// reading and not a fact: anything older than a few seconds shown as "now" is
// a lie the card tells confidently. Long enough that a page left open does not
// put a round trip per card into every poll; the reachability check beside this
// keeps its own, longer memory, and this rides the connection that opens.
