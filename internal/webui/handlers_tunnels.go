// The panel used to be able only to watch: tunnels were created, edited and
// restarted from the CLI menu over SSH, and the dashboard said "monitoring
// only" out loud. Everything here is that menu, reachable from the browser —
// the setup wizard, the edit screen and the four service actions.
//
// Nothing new is decided in this file. Each handler validates that the request
// is well-formed and hands it to the same manage function the CLI calls, so
// there is one definition of what a tunnel is and one place where it is
// written. All of it sits behind requireAuth: the read-only remote token can
// watch a tunnel, never change one.

// kilobytes; anything near this is a mistake or an attack.
