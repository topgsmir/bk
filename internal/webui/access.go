// Who is allowed to do what, decided in one place.
//
// The panel had one password and one level of access. Anyone who could open it
// could change anything, and nothing was written down afterwards — so "who
// restarted the tunnel at 3am" had no answer, and there was no way to give
// somebody the ability to look without also giving them the ability to act.
//
// The Telegram bot already had the right model and had had it for a while:
// ReadOnly on an admin, enforced at one function, canWrite, which every action
// asks. That vocabulary is ported here rather than a second one invented,
// because two permission models in one product is how a gap appears between
// them.
//
// Three things live here and they are deliberately one file:
//
//   - scope: what a request is allowed to do;
//   - tokens: a credential for callers that are not browsers, scoped the same
//     way — which is also what puts /metrics back within reach of a scraper;
//   - the audit record, written by the same choke point that grants access, so
//     an action cannot be permitted without being recorded.
//
// The last point is the design. An audit log written by each handler is a log
// with holes in it, one per handler somebody forgot. Written by the guard, the
// only way to skip the record is to skip the authorisation.

// Scope is what a caller may do. The order matters: a larger scope includes a
// smaller one.
