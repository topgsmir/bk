// What stopped a cross-site request was a chain of three: a SameSite=Lax
// session cookie, a POST requirement on every mutating handler, and a base path
// nobody can guess. Each link holds, and the shape of it is what is worth
// noticing — the last link is a secret in the address bar, which makes the base
// path a load-bearing control rather than the obscurity it is described as.
//
// Sec-Fetch-Site is the one check that is about the question being asked, and a
// browser will not lie about it.
