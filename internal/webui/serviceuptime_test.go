// A tunnel's uptime is how long its service has been up, read from systemd.

// collector was made. The engine makes a new collector for every generation —
// every reload of its file, every restart asked for over the control socket —
// so the card's "up 4m" meant "since something last touched this tunnel", not
// "since it was started", and an operator reading it after logging in saw a
// number that had nothing to do with how long the tunnel had been carrying
