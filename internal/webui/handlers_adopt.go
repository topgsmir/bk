// Linking a tunnel that already exists to the server that holds its other end.
//
// Everything the fleet does for a tunnel — carrying an edit across, starting
// both halves together, reading the far journal — is gated on a record saying
// where that other half lives. Until now that record was written in exactly one place: the
// moment the panel created both ends at once. A tunnel made any other way, or
// made before the server was added to the fleet, could never get one.
//
// So a fleet could hold the very server a tunnel runs on and do none of it.

// farEndsOn asks one managed server what tunnels it has, and keeps only the

// A tunnel name over there is a filename in that server's config directory, and
// that server chose it. On Linux a filename holds anything but "/" and NUL, so
// a name can carry quotes, angle brackets or a script tag — and the panel puts
// these names on screen, into confirmations and into a stored pairing. The
// escaping at the sink is what stops that being an injection; this is the
// second half, which is that data crossing a trust boundary is checked when it
// arrives rather than trusted because the far side produced it.
//
// A name this panel would refuse to create is a name it will not adopt either.
// Dropping the row rather than the whole answer is deliberate: one oddly named
// tunnel on a server must not make its other tunnels unpairable.
