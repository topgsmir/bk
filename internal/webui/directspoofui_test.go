// The direct form is the panel's half of the forged-source carrier. Until this,
// it could create a spoof tunnel and set exactly one thing about it — the peer
// address — while the CLI asked six questions. A form that offers a carrier and
// then cannot configure it is worse than one that does not offer it: the tunnel
// gets built on defaults nobody chose.

// What the edit sends must decode into DirectEdit, whose pointers are what let
// an absent key and a deliberate zero be told apart.
