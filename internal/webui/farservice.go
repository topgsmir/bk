// What the far end says about the last hop.
//
// A reverse tunnel's forwarded service lives on the machine the panel is not
// running on. When nothing is listening there, every connection is delivered
// across a healthy tunnel and refused one step past the end of it — and this
// side sees a tunnel that is up, a peer that is connected, and counters that
// move. It is right about all three. The reading it is missing is on the other
// machine, and until now the only way to it was to open that machine's journal.
//
// Managed servers are reachable, so it is asked for. The cost is what has to be
// controlled: the tunnels page polls, and a call per tunnel per poll would put
// an SSH round trip on every card every few seconds. So the answer is cached
// for far longer than the poll interval, in the same way and for the same
// reason the runner caches reachability.

// farServiceTTL is how long one server's answer stands for.
//
// A service that has gone down stays down until somebody fixes it, and one that
// has been fixed is worth seeing quickly — but not at the cost of an SSH round
// trip per card per poll. A minute is short enough that the operator sees their
// fix land while they are still looking, and long enough that a page left open
// costs one call a minute per server rather than one per second.

// the fleet, and a server that has gone away would stall it entirely — which is
