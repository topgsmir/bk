/* One journal line, taken apart.
 *
 * The server reads the journal as short-iso — "2026-09-29T17:59:21+03:30 host
 * bk[12]: …" — and the pattern the Logs dialog used was written for the
 * classic "Sep 29 17:59:21" form, so it matched nothing: every row carried the
 * date, the host name and the process in front of the message, and no clock.
 * Inside that is the engine's own line, "29-Sep 17:59:21 [INFO] …", whose tag
 * is the level it was logged at — a better answer than guessing from words.
 *
 * Pure, so paneltest/logline.test.js can hold it to that.
