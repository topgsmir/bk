 * There is one code path and it is the real one. The panel used to carry a

 * were drawn before the server existed. It outlived its purpose twice over: the
 * fixtures were never shipped inside the binary, so forcing that mode on a real
 * panel fetched files that are not there and drew an empty server over a busy
 * one; and having somewhere for made-up numbers to come from is what let so
 * many of them survive on screens that were supposed to have been wired up.
