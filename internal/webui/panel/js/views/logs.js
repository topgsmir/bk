/* Patterns worth explaining, and what to do about each.

 * The panel only speaks when it recognises something — a diagnosis that is
 * always on screen is decoration, and decoration that looks like a finding is
 * worse than silence.
 *
 * `when` is the second half of recognising it. Matching a phrase says the line
 * appeared; it does not say the explanation applies. The segment-overflow entry
 * was the case that proved it: it told an operator on 1.7.7.5 to "update to
 * 1.7.5 or later" — advice to install something older than what they were
 * running — and it said the layer-3 read was failing on a TCP reverse tunnel,
 * which has no layer-3 read to fail. Both halves of that were confidently
 * wrong, on a screen somebody had opened precisely because they wanted to know
 * what was wrong.
 *
 * So an entry may also say what has to be true of the tunnel and the version.
 * When it cannot be, the panel says nothing, which is the honest answer. */
