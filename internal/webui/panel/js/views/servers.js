/* Servers — the managed fleet.
 *
 * One of the panel's two sections, beside the tunnels, so it is a page in #view
 * rather than a dialog over one.
 *
 * It used to hand the operator a line to run on the other machine and then
 * watch for that machine to appear. It does not any more: the panel logs into
 * the server over its own SSH, which is already running and already how that
 * machine is administered. So adding a server is a form and an answer, the way
 * everything else in the panel is, and there is nothing to carry anywhere.
 *
 * CLI: nothing. There is no bk state on a managed server to configure.
