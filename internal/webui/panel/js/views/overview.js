/* Overview — the whole installation in one screen.
 *
 * It repeats nothing from the strip above it. The strip is this machine right
 * now — processor, memory, what is moving this second. This page is everything
 * that is not a live meter: what has been carried since the server was set up,
 * which tunnels carried it, and whatever is currently wrong.
 *
 * Three rules it is built to:
 *
 *   Trouble first. A page that opens with healthy numbers and hides the one
 *   failure among them is a page that gets glanced at and trusted.
 *
 *   Compact over complete. Every block here answers a question someone actually
 *   asks. A figure nobody acts on is one more thing to read past.
 *
 *   The motion carries meaning or it does not run. Bars grow to their value and
 *   the total counts to it, so the eye is told what changed; nothing loops,
 *   nothing decorates, and prefers-reduced-motion turns all of it off.
