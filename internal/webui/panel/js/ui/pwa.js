/* The panel as an app on a phone.
 *
 * Three things make a browser treat a site as installable: a manifest, a
 * service worker that handles fetch, and a secure context. The server has
 * served the first two since the classic panel (handlers_app.go); this is the
 * half that was lost when the panel was rebuilt — nothing linked the manifest
 * and nothing registered the worker, so no phone ever offered to install it.
 *
 * The secure context is the operator's part. A service worker only registers
 * over HTTPS with a certificate the browser trusts, so Android and desktop
 * Chrome install from Let's Encrypt or an own certificate, and not from plain
 * HTTP or a self-signed one. iOS is different: "Add to Home Screen" makes an
 * app of any page that asks for it in its meta tags, worker or not.
 *
 * Installed, the panel runs full screen with no browser bar. body.app marks
 * that, and the stylesheet uses it to keep the header and the last row clear
 * of the notch and the home indicator. */
