// What the panel is doing, measured by the panel.
//
// /metrics reported the tunnels and the host and said nothing about the process
// serving it. That is the component an operator reaches for when something is
// wrong, it is root on the machine, and it was the one thing on the box with no
// numbers at all — so "the panel is slow" or "the panel is being hammered" had
// no answer but a guess.
//
// Deliberately small. Four things, none of which needs a time series database
// to be useful:
//
//   - how many requests, by outcome, because a rising count of 4xx on the token
//     endpoints is somebody guessing and a rising count of 5xx is this program
//     being wrong;
//   - how long they take, as a running maximum and a total, because a panel
//     that has become slow shows up there before anybody complains;
//   - how many background jobs have run and how many failed;
//   - how long this process has been up, which is the first thing anybody asks
//     and was not being reported either.
//
// No per-path cardinality. A label per URL on a panel with a secret base path
// is a metric that grows with the number of paths anybody has ever probed,
// which on a port that gets scanned is unbounded — and the class of the answer
// is what matters here, not which of forty endpoints served it.
