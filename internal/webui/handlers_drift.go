// What the fleet is supposed to be running, against what it is.
//
// Every fleet operation was imperative: the panel told a node to create a
// tunnel, the node said it had, and that was the end of it. Nothing remembered
// the instruction, so nothing could notice it had stopped being true — a tunnel
// removed on the far machine, a unit disabled during an incident and never
// re-enabled, an apply that reported success and then lost its config. All of
// them leave a fleet that looks correct here and is not.
//
// This asks each node what it has and compares it with what was written down.
// It changes nothing: see internal/control/desired.go for why re-applying on
// its own would be the wrong shape for this product in particular.
