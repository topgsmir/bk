// A second factor for the panel.
//
// The panel is root on the machine. Everything it can do — edit a tunnel,
// restore a backup, install an update, read a token — is done as root, and the
// whole of it was behind one password. A password is the credential most likely
// to be reused, phished or read out of another breach, and the panel is on a
// public port by necessity.
//
// So: a time-based one-time code, RFC 6238, in about a hundred lines and with
// no dependency. There is nothing to a TOTP but an HMAC over a counter and a
// truncation, and the algorithm has not changed since 2011. A library would be
// a supply-chain surface for code this size.
//
// # The choices, and why
//
// **SHA-1, 6 digits, 30 seconds.** Not because they are the strongest options
// but because they are what every authenticator app defaults to, and an
// operator who has to hand-configure an entry is an operator who gives up and
// leaves the second factor off. The HMAC's key is a fresh 160-bit random
// secret, and SHA-1 in HMAC is not affected by the collision attacks that
// retired it for signatures.
//
// **One step of tolerance either way.** A phone's clock and a VPS's clock are
// both set by NTP and are rarely more than a second or two apart, but "rarely"
// is not "never", and a code refused because a clock drifted is an operator
// locked out of their own server. Ninety seconds of acceptance costs
// essentially nothing against brute force once the login rate limiter is in
// front of it.
//
// **Recovery codes, and they are the point.** A second factor whose only key is
// a phone is a way to lose a server. Ten single-use codes are generated with
// the secret, shown once, and stored hashed — so the file on the server is not
// a way in, and a code that has been used cannot be used again.
