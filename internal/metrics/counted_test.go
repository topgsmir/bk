// wrapping both would count every byte twice, since each one also crosses a
// local socket.

// This wrapper briefly carried a ReadFrom/WriteTo pair, so that io.Copy could
// splice between the two sockets of a relay without the bytes passing through
// this process. It was removed: the forwarded relay is back to the plain
// read/write loop the upstream project uses, and counting follows it.
