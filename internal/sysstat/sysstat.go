// Package sysstat reads the handful of machine-level numbers that both the web
// panel and the Telegram bot report on: processor, memory, swap, disk, load and
// uptime.
//
// It exists because the panel imports the bot (it starts it), so the bot cannot
// import the panel back. Rather than sampling the same counters twice with two
// sets of rounding, both read them here — an alert that says 86% and a
// dashboard that says 85% for the same instant is a support question nobody
// should have to answer.
