// Get uses cpu.Percent with a zero interval, which reports the delta since the
// last call in the same process. That is right for the panel and the monitor,
// which are long-lived and call it on a timer. It is meaningless in `bk
// node exec` — a process that starts, answers one question and exits — because
// there is no previous call: the only delta available is the one since the
// package initialised microseconds earlier. Over a window that short /proc/stat
// has usually not ticked at all, and gopsutil then returns 0 when nothing moved
// and 100 when a single jiffy landed.
//
// That is why a managed server's card jumped between 0%, 100% and 50% on every
// poll while the machine sat idle. The readings were not noisy; they were
// arithmetic on a window of no length.
//
// So the one thing worth pinning is that this actually waits. A version that
// returns immediately is the bug, whatever number it happens to produce.
