// controlLoop serves one generation's control channel on the server side:
// it beats the heartbeat, asks the client for a tunnel connection whenever the
// forwarder queues a user, listens for the client's goodbye, and says the
// server's own goodbye when the generation ends.
//
// All seven transports had their own copy of this loop, and the copies had
// drifted: two read one byte and stopped listening, the readers of the others
// could block forever on a full channel once their loop had returned, the
// websocket pair dropped the tunnel on a signal it did not know, and every copy
// wrote to whatever control channel the transport held at the moment of
// writing — which, for a goroutine running late, is the next generation's. The
// loop is here once now, bound to the connection it was started with, and a
// transport chooses only how the signals travel (link, see controlwire),
// whether to measure the round trip, and how long its goodbye needs
// (farewellFlush).
