// controlClaimTimeout is how long the server waits for a freshly accepted peer
// to say who it is before dropping it.
//
// It is the server's half of the number the client calls controlAckTimeout, and
// it is generous for the same reason. The token arrives in the first segment
// after the connection is up, so on a lossy path the wait is not a round trip
// but a round trip plus however many retransmissions it takes to land: TCP's
// first retransmission is a second out, the next three, the next seven. Two
// seconds — which is what the udp transport asked for — covers barely one of
// those, so on the kind of path this tunnel exists for the handshake failed,
// the client backed off and dialled again, and the tunnel flapped without ever
// being disconnected in any way the operator could see.
//
// Waiting longer costs one goroutine per silent peer and nothing else:
// admission runs in the connection's own goroutine precisely so that a peer
// which connects and says nothing never delays the ones behind it.

// tunnelHeaderTimeout bounds how long the ws/wsmux tunnel port waits for a
// request's headers — and, on wss, for the TLS handshake, which net/http times
// by the same setting.
//
// The port is public and unauthenticated until a request arrives, and it had
// no bound at all: a peer that connected and sent nothing held a goroutine and
// a file descriptor for as long as it liked, and a slow one also stalled the
// server's graceful shutdown at every restart. Fifteen seconds is the budget
// the direct engine's websocket listener already uses. net/http clears the
// deadline once the headers are in, so an upgraded tunnel is not affected.
// A variable so a test can shorten it.

// with a local address in front of it (`10.0.0.5:443`, `[::1]:443-450`). A bare
// port listens on every interface; naming an address pins that listener to one
// local IP, which is what a multi-homed host needs in order to keep the control
// channel and the exposed ports on separate public addresses — without it both
// land on 0.0.0.0 and the second bind of a shared port number fails with
// "address already in use".
//
// The address was previously understood for a single port only. Every transport
// inlined this parsing and every one of them tested for "-" before it looked for
// a host, so `10.0.0.5:443-450` took the range branch and handed the whole

// a range carry one too, and writing it once is what keeps the seven transports
