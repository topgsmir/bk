// tcpTunnelPort is the tunnel port of the transports that carry the tunnel over
// plain TCP — tcp (and stealth, which is tcp under Noise) and tcpmux. It binds
// the port with the tunnel's socket options, retrying rather than exiting when
// the port is taken, accepts for as long as the generation runs, applies the
// options to each accepted connection, and hands it to admit in a goroutine of
// its own. The two transports had a copy each; what differs between them —
// what admitting a connection means — is admit.
