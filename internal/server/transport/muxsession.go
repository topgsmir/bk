// What a mux transport does with a session, written once.
//
// `tcpmux`, `wsmux` and `kcp` all reach the same place by different roads: a
// smux session, over TCP, over a websocket, or over KCP. From there the three
// of them did exactly the same thing — take a waiting local connection, open a
// stream, announce the backend, relay — and they did it in three copies that
// were character-for-character identical apart from the receiver's type and two
// comments.
//
// That is the same shape of duplication pairloop.go was written for, and it has
// the same history. Every fault found in this loop had to be found three times:
//
//   - the pooled slot was not released when a connection timed out waiting to
//     be paired, so a tunnel with max_connections lost a slot to every timeout
//     until it refused everything;
//   - the mux slot was not given back when announcing the backend failed, so a
//     session that failed that way MuxCon times stopped taking connections at
//     all — the loop blocks at the top on a counter that is full, and the only
//     goroutine that empties it is the one that is blocked;
//   - a connection that could not be requeued was left counted, so the stream
//     counter drifted upward and the pool stopped asking for connections.
//
// Each was fixed once per copy. This is the one copy.
//
// # What is still per transport
//
// Everything above the session: how to listen, how to accept, how to get a
// smux session out of whatever arrived, and when to ask for another. Those are
// genuinely different. What happens once a session exists is not, and this is
// the whole of it.

// muxSession is one smux session and everything it needs from the transport
// that owns it.
//
// The counters are pointers rather than values because they belong to the
// transport and outlive any one session — a session that ends must leave them
// where the next one can see them.
