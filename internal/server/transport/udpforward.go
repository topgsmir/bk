// Forwarded UDP, for every transport.
//
// A forwarded port used to mean a TCP listener and nothing else. Only the plain
// TCP transport could carry datagrams, only behind accept_udp, and it did it
// with its own private copy of the logic — so a tunnel on tcpmux, ws, wss,
// wsmux, kcp or quic simply never bound the UDP port. Nothing said so. The
// datagrams were refused by the kernel, and the operator saw a forwarded port
// where TCP worked and UDP did not, which is what Xray, 3x-ui and Shadowsocks
// users kept running into.
//
// The fix is this file: one UDP forwarder, and each flow presented as an
// ordinary net.Conn. Every transport already knows how to pair a net.Conn with
// a tunnel connection and pipe the two together — that is exactly what it does
// for TCP — so handing it a datagram flow wearing the same shape means
// forwarded UDP works everywhere without a second implementation of the
// pairing, the limits, the metrics or the teardown.
//
// The wire format is network.WriteDatagram/ReadDatagram: two bytes of length,
// then the payload. udpFlow.Read produces it and udpFlow.Write consumes it, so
// the bytes between the two ends are frames however the transport chunks them.

// udpIdleTimeout is how long a flow with no traffic in either direction is
// kept. UDP has no close, so the only way a flow ends is by going quiet: this
// is the NAT-style mapping lifetime, and it has to outlast the gaps a real
// protocol leaves. 60s covers a DNS exchange many times over and sits inside
// the 30-120s most home routers use for their own UDP mappings, so a peer that
// keeps its side alive keeps ours alive too.
const udpIdleTimeout = 60 * time.Second

// udpFlowQueue is how many datagrams may wait for the tunnel connection that
// will carry them. A flow's first datagrams arrive before the transport has
// paired it with a stream, and dropping those loses the handshake that starts
// every session — which reads as "UDP does not work" rather than as one lost
// packet. Deep enough to absorb that pause, bounded so a peer that floods a
// stalled flow cannot grow the process without limit.

// the flow is then dropped whole, so the next datagram from that address starts
// a fresh attempt.
//
// That last part is the difference between a busy moment and a dead flow. The
