// The report this exists for: a tunnel that ran for three weeks, then began
// refusing its own client with "the server already has a control channel from
// somebody else" — on a tunnel that has exactly one client.
//
// Nothing on the server side reads the control channel with a deadline, and a
// heartbeat written into a dead-but-unreset socket lands in the send buffer and
// reports success. So the server can hold a control channel whose peer has been
// gone for a long time. The client does keep a read deadline, so it notices in
// seconds and re-dials — into a refusal it can do nothing about, for as long as
// the stale socket survives.
//
// Every transport now seats such a claim in place (see clientSeat); these pin
// it for the stream transports.

// a real address, and a pipe fails its next read the moment it is closed, which
