// three-second crash loop. Measured with one forwarded port of two taken: the
// control channel came up, the healthy port was never bound, and the process
// was gone four seconds later.

// Fatalf is the whole hazard, so this guards the word itself rather than any
// one call: reintroducing it anywhere in a transport brings the crash loop
