// lifecycle is the part of every reverse server transport that owns its runs.
//
// A transport runs in generations. A generation is one control channel and
// everything that serves it — the tunnel listener, the forwarded ports, the
// pairing workers — sharing one context. When the control channel is lost the
// transport ends the generation and starts the next one in the same process.
// That sequence was written out seven times, once per transport, and every
// copy had to get the same things right: one restart at a time, waiting for the
// old generation's ports instead of sleeping, not rebuilding anything once the
// whole tunnel is shutting down, and clearing the peer on every way out. It is
// here once now; a transport supplies only how to close its control channel and
// how to build and start its next generation.
//
// What outlives a generation is exactly what is on this struct and the
// transport's configuration-derived fields (limits, counters); everything a
// generation owns is built fresh for it and handed to its start function.
