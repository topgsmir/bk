// The identity the decoy site wears.
//
// Answering a probe with a plausible page is only half of the job. The other
// half is that it must not be the *same* plausible page on every install, and
// until now it was: every bk server on earth returned byte-identical
// bytes — one trimmed welcome page, `Server: nginx`, and nothing else. No
// Last-Modified, no ETag, no Accept-Ranges, the same Content-Length everywhere.
//
// That inverts what the decoy is for. A single server looked unremarkable, but
// the fleet became enumerable: one internet-wide scan for that exact response
// finds every bk server there is, no token and no probing required. A
// camouflage shared by everyone wearing it is a uniform.
//
// So the identity is derived from the tunnel token — which nginx build the
// server claims to be, whether that build was compiled to print its version,
// when its index.html was last written, and therefore its ETag. The token is
// secret and different on every install, so the values cannot be predicted from
// outside and no two servers share them. It is a hash rather than a random
// draw, so one server keeps its identity across restarts — a real file on a
// real disk does not change its date when the machine reboots.
//
// The other half of looking real is answering like a static file server rather
// than like a program with one canned reply. Stock nginx serves index.html at
// `/` and a 404 everywhere else; it honours conditional and range requests. It
// does not return the same 200 HTML for every path anybody asks for.
