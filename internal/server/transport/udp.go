// udpPayloadQueue is how many datagrams may wait for the goroutine that will
// forward them — per forwarded flow, and per pooled tunnel connection.
//
// It was 100_000. A Go channel allocates its whole buffer the moment it is
// made, so at 24 bytes for a slice header that reserved 2.3 MB for every
// connection the moment it was seen, whether or not it went on to carry a
// single byte. A pool of 64 idle connections was 145 MB of a 153 MB heap on a
// tunnel that was forwarding nothing at all.
//
// 256 is the depth the forwarded-UDP path already settled on for the same job
// (see udpFlowQueue): deep enough to absorb the pause while a flow waits to be
// paired with a tunnel connection — dropping there costs the opening packet of
// a session, which reads as "UDP does not work" rather than as one lost packet
// — and bounded, so a peer that floods a stalled flow cannot grow the process
// without limit.

// the socket closing, so one that repeats does not spin a core.
const udpReadErrorPause = 50 * time.Millisecond

// idleForward is how long a forwarded UDP flow may go without a packet before
// its two copy goroutines give up on it.
//
// A named constant because it was written out twice, as a local in each copy
// loop, and the words around it had drifted from the value: the case comment
// said thirty seconds, the log line said sixty, and the variable said sixty.
// UDP has no close, so this is the only thing that ends a flow.
