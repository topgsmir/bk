// A control channel that cannot be written to has to be given up on.
//
// This is the bug report: a tunnel that broke and stayed broken until it was
// restarted by hand. The log is thousands of "the queue is full, dropping a
// client" a second, interleaved with "a control channel is already established;
// refusing the claim", and then — minutes later — one
// "write: connection timed out" followed by a restart that fixed everything.
//
// The order of those is the whole story. The control channel's path had gone,
// but a write to it does not fail: it lands in the kernel's send buffer, and
// once that fills the write blocks until the kernel stops retransmitting, which
// is about fifteen minutes on Linux defaults. Throughout that window the server
// still held a control channel, so:
//
//   - it refused every attempt by the client to establish a new one, because
//     one was "already established";
//   - it could not ask for pool connections, because the request went into the
//     same buffer nobody was draining;
//   - and it therefore dropped every user connection with the pool empty.
//
// The tunnel was down and nothing it could do would bring it back. The operator
// restarting it was the only thing that ever cleared the state.
