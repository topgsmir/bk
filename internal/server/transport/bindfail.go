// What happens when a port cannot be bound.
//
// Every listener in these transports used to answer a failed bind with
// logger.Fatalf, which is os.Exit(1). The unit these run under carries
// Restart=always and RestartSec=3, so an occupied port did not stop the tunnel
// — it put it in a three-second crash loop: bind, die, restart, bind, die.
//
// Measured on one forwarded port out of two: the control channel came up, the
// healthy port was never bound at all, the process was gone four seconds later,
// and the log's last line was
//
//	[FATAL] failed to listen on :62050: bind: address already in use
//
// From the far end that reads as a tunnel connecting and dropping every few
// seconds for no stated reason, which is exactly how it was reported.
//
// One busy port is a configuration mistake on one port. It is not a reason to
// take down a tunnel whose other ports are fine, and it is certainly not a
// reason to exit a process that a supervisor will immediately start again.
//
// The direct and layer-3 forwarders already had this right — they return the
// error and let the caller decide. This brings the reverse transports to the
// same place.

// bindFailure explains a listener that could not be opened.
//
// Written like the client's local-dial message and for the same reason: the
// bare error ("bind: address already in use") is accurate and nearly useless.
// It does not say which machine, which port, or what to do about it — and the
// operator reading it is usually looking at the wrong server. This says all
// three, and prints the command that names the process holding the port, which
// is the one thing the log cannot know and the operator can find in a second.

// is measured in milliseconds: that one paces a loop that is spinning, this one
