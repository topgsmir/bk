// Reading a connection's announcement off the accept path.
//
// Every connection arriving on the tunnel port now says what it is before it is
// filed — a control channel offering the token, or a pool connection offering
// the nonce from the current run. Two things follow from that, and both are the
// point of doing it this way.
//
// The read happens in the connection's own goroutine. It used to happen in a
// single loop that took one connection at a time and blocked on it, which meant
// anything that connected and then said nothing cost every connection queued
// behind it the full timeout. On a public address that is not a rare event —
// port scanners and probes find an open port within hours — and the effect was
// that the tunnel's own client could not get a control channel established
// while a scanner was working through the port. A connection that says nothing
// now costs one goroutine and nothing else.
//
// And because a pool connection announces itself, the server can tell one from
// a stranger's by what it knows rather than by where it dialled from. See
// network.PoolNonce for why that matters.

// announceTimeout is how long a freshly accepted connection has to say what it
// is. It is generous — the client sends immediately, so this only has to cover
// a slow path, not a slow peer — because the cost of waiting is now one idle
// goroutine.

// Closing without a word is what this replaces, and it cost real time: a wrong

// which is also what an old server produces — so the client picked the wrong
// one of the three and sent operators off to upgrade servers that were fine.
//
// Best effort. The refusal is a courtesy on a connection that is about to be
// dropped either way, so a peer that has already gone, or one that will not
// read it, changes nothing: the close below happens regardless.
// The reason travels as the payload and SG_Refused as the signal, which is the
// same shape every other answer on this path takes. A client too old to know
// the signal compares the payload against its own token, fails to match, and
// reports an invalid token — the wrong wording, but pointing at the right half

// settle here: three transports comparing the tunnel's only credential one way

// version the client must use (see network.ResolveMuxVersion).
//
// A legacy handshake yields an empty nonce and version 0, which leaves pool
// authorisation off — the transport falls back to matching source addresses —
// and leaves the mux version to each end's own configuration, exactly as it
// was before either mechanism existed.
// It returns the version it actually promised rather than the one it was
// offered, so the caller records what the client was told and not what the

// that ran a different version from the one it announced would produce exactly
