// Package cli is the non-interactive face of the same operations the menu
// offers.
//
// Everything BackPack does from a terminal has until now gone through
// internal/menu: 1,400 lines that read stdin and write stdout directly. That
// shape has two costs and they are the same cost seen from two sides. Nothing
// can drive it, so nothing tests it — it is the largest package in the tree
// with no test file. And nothing can script it, so the answer to "how do I
// check every server's tunnels from cron" has been "you cannot".
//
// The fix is not to test the menu. It is to give the same operations an entry
// point that has no I/O in it at all:
//
//	Run(args) -> Result{Out, Err, Code}
//
// That is the whole interface. Everything a caller needs to know is in it, the
// behaviour behind it is the same manage package the menu and the panel both
// call, and a test drives it by passing a string slice and reading a struct.
// main.go does the printing and the exiting, which is the only part that
// genuinely needs a process.
//
// It is deliberately thin over manage rather than a second home for logic:
// manage is already the seam the panel and the menu meet at, and a third caller
// that reimplemented any of it would be a third place for the answers to
// diverge. What lives here is what a command line needs and a menu does not —
// parsing arguments, choosing between human and machine output, and deciding
// an exit code.
