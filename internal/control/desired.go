// What a managed server is supposed to be running, and what it is running.
//
// Every fleet operation was imperative: the panel told a node to create a
// tunnel, the node said it had, and that was the end of it. Nothing remembered
// the instruction, so nothing could ever notice that it had stopped being true.
// A tunnel deleted on the far machine by somebody with a terminal, a unit
// disabled during an incident and never re-enabled, an apply that reported
// success and then lost its config to a rollback — all of them leave a fleet
// that looks correct on the panel and is not, and the only way to find out was
// to go and look.
//
// This is the missing half: the panel writes down what it asked for, and the
// answer to "list your tunnels" can then be compared with it.
//
// # Detection, not remediation
//
// Nothing here changes a remote machine. Reconcile returns differences and that
// is all it does.
//
// That is a deliberate stopping point rather than an unfinished one. A
// reconciler that re-applies on its own is a loop that can fight an operator
// who is in the middle of something, and on this product the thing it would be
// fighting over is the tunnel that operator is reaching the machine through.
// What an operator needs first is to be told; what to do about it is a decision
// with their hand on it.
//
// # Why the intent is not derived from the config
//
// The panel writes both ends when it builds a pair, so it could in principle
// re-read its own side and infer the far one. It cannot infer the two facts
// that matter most: that the far end was *meant* to exist at all, and that it
// was meant to be running. A tunnel that is absent and a tunnel that was never
// created look identical from here, and those are the two cases this exists to
// tell apart.

// the same permissions as every other secret this panel holds. It holds no
// credentials, but it does describe somebody's infrastructure.

//
// It carries what identifies a tunnel and what is worth noticing when it

// question should not also be a file that opens the tunnel.
