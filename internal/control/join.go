// Adding a server to the fleet, as a decision rather than as a form handler.
//
// This was three hundred lines into an HTTP handler, mixed with form parsing
// and with ten other actions, and it is the one of them that is not a
// pass-through: it reaches the machine while the operator is still looking at
// the form, installs Backpack when the machine has none, and takes the entry
// back out when it cannot be reached at all.
//
// None of that is about HTTP. It was reachable only through a POST, so a CLI
// that wanted to add a server had to either drive the panel or write the
// sequence again — and a sequence written twice is a sequence where the second
// copy forgets the back-out.
//
// # Why it is reached now rather than on first use
//
// The alternative is to save the details and let the first real operation
// discover that the password is wrong, which is the shape the old flow had and
// is why a server could sit in the fleet doing nothing with nothing saying why.
// A fleet entry that has never worked is not a server, it is a typo — so it is
// removed, and the operator is told which of the three things went wrong.

// Joining is what happened when a server was added.
