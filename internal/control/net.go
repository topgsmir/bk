// What the path between this panel and each managed server is actually like.
//
// The fleet card had a row at the bottom repeating the login it was reached
// with — the user, an at sign and the address, all three of which are on the
// card already or in the form behind it. That space is worth something better:
// the panel runs on the Iran side and every managed server is on the other end
// of the route that matters, so the one thing it can say there that nothing
// else on the screen says is how that route is behaving.
//
// Loss rather than latency alone, because latency on these paths is mostly
// distance and does not change, while loss is what a filtered or congested
// route does first and is what a tunnel over it feels.
//
// Measured here rather than on the server: a figure the far end reports is
// about its own view of the path, and the question being asked is about this
// one.

// that as "100% loss" on a card would be a confident lie about a server that
// is working perfectly, so an unanswered probe is recorded as not measured and
