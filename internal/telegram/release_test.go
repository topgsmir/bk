// The release announcement is the one alert with no condition to recover from.
// Everything else here reports a threshold that is crossed and later is not, so
// a repeat is self-limiting; a version stays newer forever, and an announcement
// that does not remember itself becomes a message every check, for good. That
// makes "once, and only once" the property worth holding down.

// stageRelease points the update cache at a temporary file that says tag is the
// newest release. It writes the cache file the alert loop actually reads rather
// than stubbing the lookup, so the test covers the real path — and it never
// touches GitHub or the machine's own state.
