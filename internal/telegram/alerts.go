// Alerting.
//
// A status report every N hours tells you what was true when the cron fired.
// It does not tell you that the processor has been pinned since twenty minutes
// ago, or that a tunnel dropped and came back. This watches continuously and
// speaks only when something changes.
//
// Two rules keep it from becoming noise, which is the failure mode that makes
// people mute a monitoring bot and then miss the outage that mattered:
//
//   - Hysteresis. An alert fires when a reading crosses the threshold and does
//     not fire again until the reading has fallen clearly below it. A value
//     hovering on the line produces one message, not forty.
//   - Cooldown. While a condition persists, it is repeated at most once per
//     cooldown, as a reminder rather than a stream.
//
// Every alert has a matching recovery message, because "CPU is at 94%" is only
// actionable if you also learn when it stopped.

// disables that check.
