// Choosing which tunnel carries the bot's traffic.
//
// The Iran server cannot reach Telegram directly, so every request goes through
// a tunnel to a peer abroad and out from there. Which tunnel was a question the
// user had to answer at setup — and then answer again, by hand, whenever that
// particular tunnel went down. Meanwhile the bot stayed silent, which is
// precisely when it is needed: a tunnel dropping is the thing worth being told
// about.
//
// So the choice is made automatically and re-made whenever the current one
// stops being usable. Any healthy tunnel will do; the only requirement is that
// it can reach the peer.

// AutoRelay is the sentinel stored in ViaTunnel to mean "pick one and keep
// picking". A specific tunnel name still pins it, so anyone who wants manual
// control keeps it.
