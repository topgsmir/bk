//
// When the bot fails, the error it surfaces is whatever the HTTP client saw —
// usually a bare "EOF" — and that error names the wrong machine. The chain has
// five links across two servers, and knowing which one broke is the entire
// difficulty. Guessing at it from the far end, one exchange at a time, is not a
// method.
//
// This walks the chain in order and stops at the first thing that is actually
// wrong, so the answer is a specific hop rather than a symptom.

// RelayStep is one link in the chain.
