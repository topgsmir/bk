// LoadState reads a JSON state file into v.
//
// A missing file is not an error: every state file starts life absent. A file
// that exists but cannot be read back is the case this is for. Treating it as
// empty — which is what reading with the error ignored does — hands the caller
// a blank state, and the caller's next save writes that blank over the only
// copy of what was there: a fleet's servers, a tunnel's pairing, a hand edit
// with a stray comma that one keystroke would have fixed.
//
// Two ways a file fails, handled apart (see Unreadable):
//
//   - It does not parse. Nothing in it is usable: the file is moved aside to
//     <path>.unreadable-<unix time>, v is reset to its zero value, and the next
//     save starts a new file.
//   - It parses, but a value has the wrong type — a hand edit, or a newer or
//     older build that changed a field. Everything else was read: v keeps it,
//     and a copy of the file is kept beside it, so the field the next save
//     drops can still be recovered.
//
// Either way the error says what happened and where the copy is.
