// one per tunnel — and they share these config files: the CLI writes them, the
// others read them on a timer. A plain os.WriteFile truncates the file before
// it writes, so a reader landing in that window sees an empty or partial file.
// For a config that means being read as "not configured", which for the monitor
// means an iteration with no bot and no alerts.
//
// Rename is atomic within a filesystem, so a reader sees either the whole old
// file or the whole new one, never a mixture.
