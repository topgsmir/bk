// different SHA256SUMS as well: the list travels the same channel as the
// thing it describes, over the third-party proxies these machines are
// obliged to use. Signing the list closes that, because the signature is
// checked against a key that travelled with the binary already running.
//
// Empty meant this build checked checksums and nothing more, which is what
// every build before v1.8.2 did. It is no longer empty, and that changes the

// carrying this key, a release without a valid signature is refused rather
// than warned about.** So the RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY secret has to be in place
// before the next tag is pushed, or that release will not install anywhere.
//
// Rotating is the same operation and is not free: a machine running an older
// binary trusts the old key and will refuse a release signed with a new one
// until it has been updated by some other route. Publish one release carrying
// the new public key while still signing with the old private key, then
// switch.

// never binds. And being identical everywhere makes it trivially guessable.
