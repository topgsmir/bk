// Package enginectl is the engine's local control socket.
//
// # The rung that was missing
//
// The watchdog's only lever on a tunnel was `systemctl restart`, and
// internal/manage/throughputhealth.go says so where the graduated response is
// described: "an engine runs as its own process with no control socket, so
// 're-dial', 'rebuild the pool' and 'restart the transport' are not available to
// ask for without building an IPC channel first. Pretending otherwise would
// mean a ladder whose rungs are all the same rung."
//
// This is that channel, and it makes one rung real: the engine can restart its
// own transport in place. That is a smaller act than restarting the process and
// a better one — the process keeps its metrics history, its uptime, its
// accumulated counters and its log continuity, and nothing else on the machine
// has to be told. A stall that clears on a transport restart never reaches the
// `systemctl` rung at all.
//
// # Why a unix socket and not a port
//
// It is reachable only by something already on the machine and running as root.
// The socket is 0600 under /run/bk, which is 0700, so the attack surface
// added is exactly the attack surface of already being root — which is to say
// none. A TCP port, however tightly bound, is one firewall mistake away from
// being reachable, and this is a channel that restarts tunnels.
//
// # Why it speaks the shape internal/node already defines
//
// A request is an op name and a raw body; a response is ok, an error string and
// a raw body. That is the same restricted shape the panel uses to talk to a
// managed server, and it is restricted for the same reason: the set of things
// that can be asked for is a closed list in one place, not whatever the caller
// can construct. Two RPC shapes in one product is how a gap opens between them.
//
// # Why the unit does not declare a RuntimeDirectory
//
// `RuntimeDirectory=bk` is the systemd idiom and would have systemd make
// the directory with the right mode and remove it on stop. It is not used, and
// the reason is not style: the tunnel units are compared against one template
// and rewritten when they differ, so adding a line to that template restarts
// every tunnel on the machine at the next update. /run is a tmpfs and is empty
// at boot, the engine makes the directory itself, and Serve removes its own
// socket — so the line would buy nothing and cost every operator an outage.
//
// # What it deliberately does not offer
//
// "Rebuild the pool" is not here, and neither is anything else the engine cannot
// genuinely do today. An op that reports success and changes nothing is worse
// than an op that does not exist, because a ladder with a rung that does nothing
// is a ladder whose failures are invisible.
