// Sealing the one credential this machine holds for somebody else.
//
// Everything else in the config directory is a secret about this machine: a
// tunnel's token, the panel's password, the bot's. The fleet registry is
// different — it holds the root password of a *different* server, and it holds
// it because the panel logs in over SSH to manage it.
//
// It was stored in plain text. Root-only and 0600, so not a vulnerability in
// the usual sense: anything that can read it can already read everything else
// here. What made it worth changing is where the file goes. The backup archive
// is the whole config directory, and a backup is a thing people move: it is
// downloaded through the panel, sent through the Telegram bot, kept on a
// laptop, attached to a support message. Every one of those carried the root
// password of every managed server, in the clear, to somewhere nobody was
// thinking about it.
//
// So the password is encrypted with a key that is not in the backup. That is
// the whole of the protection and it is worth being exact about it:
//
//   - Against root on this machine it is worth nothing. The key is beside the
//     data and has to be, because the panel needs the password without anybody
//     present to type one.
//   - Against a copy of the backup it is worth everything, which is the case
//     that actually happens.
//
// Restoring onto the machine that took the backup works, because the key
// survives: a restore seeds the staging tree from the live directory first, so
// a file the archive does not mention is kept. Restoring onto a *different*
// machine leaves the passwords unreadable, and the fleet screen asks for them
// again — which is the correct outcome, and the one an operator would choose if
// asked whether a backup should carry them.

// sealKeyName is the key file, beside the registry it seals.
//
// Derived from StorePath rather than kept as a second variable, so anything
// that points the registry somewhere else — a test, and there are several —
// takes the key with it. Two knobs meant every caller had to know about the
// second one, and the ones that did not tried to write the key into /etc while
// their registry was safely in a temp directory.
