// Reaching a managed server over its own SSH.
//
// The enrolment channel this replaces asked a lot of the operator: open a port
// on the panel for every server, paste a setup command on the far machine, and
// keep an agent running there to hold the connection open. Three things to get
// right before anything works, and each of them a way for a server to be listed
// in the panel and unreachable anyway.
//
// SSH is already there. It is already open, already authenticated, already the
// way that machine is administered — and it dials outward from the panel, so
// the panel needs no inbound port at all. What crosses it is exactly what
// crossed the old channel: one Request in, one Response out, answered by
// Execute on the far side. The protocol did not change; only what carries it.
