// A menu whose options and cases have drifted apart.

// writing one is how the mistake was noticed. The other half is not. A
// **missing** case compiles perfectly and falls through to the default, which
// in this switch returns to the previous screen — so the operator picks an item
// and the menu simply redraws, with no error, no log line and nothing to
// suggest the item was ever meant to do something.
