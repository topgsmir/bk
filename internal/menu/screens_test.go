// Driving the screens.
//
// This package is where an operator meets the product, and it was at 3.2%
// coverage: one long interactive loop that nothing could enter without a person
// at a keyboard. Two things made it reachable — `promptLine` learned to report
// a closed input instead of spinning on it, and `tui.SetInput` lets a test be
// the keyboard.
//
// What these tests hold is deliberately narrow and deliberately the part that
// breaks. Every screen must draw, offer the options it is supposed to offer,
// and come back when it is told to go back. None of them drives a screen into
// an action: an action here writes a config, restarts a service or reaches a
// network, and a test suite that does those things on the machine running it is
// worse than no test suite.

// drive runs a screen with input as its keystrokes and returns everything it
// printed.
//
// Two safeguards, because a screen that does not read its input is a screen
// that hangs a CI run rather than failing it: the input ends (so every prompt
// after the script runs out reads a closed stdin, which is the case
// `promptLine` was taught to handle), and the whole thing is bounded.
