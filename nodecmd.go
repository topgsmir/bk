// `bk node ...` — the managed side of the panel-to-server channel.
//
// There is almost nothing here, and that is the change.
//
// This used to hold a setup command, an agent, a service unit and a way to stop
// being managed, because the far server dialled the panel and had to be told
// how: a port to reach, a key to present, a daemon to hold the connection open.
// Every one of those was a thing to install on a machine the operator only
// wanted to use, and a thing that could be wrong while the panel showed the
// server as simply offline.
//
// The panel reaches servers over their own SSH now. That is already running,
// already authenticated and already how the machine is administered — so the
// far side needs no state at all, and what is left is the one command the panel
// runs there.

  bk node exec -
        Read one request from stdin, perform it and print the answer. Both
        are JSON, base64 encoded. This is what a bk panel runs over
        SSH; there is no reason to type it. (A request given as the argument
        instead of - is still read, for an older panel.)

Nothing needs to be set up here. A panel manages this server by logging in
over SSH, so adding it to a fleet is done entirely from the panel.

// nodeExec performs one operation for a panel reaching this server over SSH.

// The request arrives on stdin when the argument is "-". It used to arrive as
// the argument itself, and a request that sets up a tunnel carries the
// tunnel's token — which, as an argument, any unprivileged user on this machine
// could read from the process list for as long as the command ran. The
// argument form is still read, for a panel older than this build. Base64
// either way: nothing in it can be read as shell syntax, whatever it holds.
//
// The answer always goes to stdout, including a refusal — the panel reads a
// Response either way, and a command that failed with nothing on stdout would
// reach it as "the far end said nothing", which is what a broken SSH looks like
// and is a different problem. The exit status stays 0 for the same reason; a
// non-zero one means this command failed, not that the operation did.
