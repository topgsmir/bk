# carriertest — run one layer-3 carrier for real, end to end.
#
# The four obfuscated carriers (pck, sni, xdi, spoof) need CAP_NET_RAW and a
# packet socket. A `go test` process has neither, so internal/e2e cannot reach
# them: the transport matrix there covers the ten reverse transports and stops.
# These four are the ones most likely to be chosen when a path is hostile, which
# makes "untested because it is awkward" the wrong place to leave them.
#
# This builds the real thing instead. Two network namespaces joined by a veth
# pair, one bk l3 tunnel between them over the carrier being tested, then
# a ping to prove the tunnel is up and two megabytes through nc to prove it
# carries data byte for byte.
#
# Usage:
#
#   go build -o /tmp/bp-carrier .
#   unshare --map-auto --map-root-user --net --mount --fork -- \
#       tools/carriertest/carriertest.sh pck
#
# Carriers: udp quic pck sni xdi spoof
#
# On Ubuntu the unprivileged namespace is confined by AppArmor and the
# capabilities are stripped inside it, so raw sockets fail even as root there.
# Clear the gate first, once per boot:
#
#   sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
#
# Two settings below are load-bearing rather than tidy, and both were learned
# from a live run: rp_filter must be 0 on conf.all AND on the receiving
# interface (the effective value is the maximum of the two, so setting one is
# setting neither), and auto_mtu must be off or the tunnel rewrites its own
# config and the reload watcher flaps it.

# Everything this script starts, stopped — however it ends.
#
# It did not, and the cost was not theoretical: a full matrix run leaves two
# engine processes and an `nc` per transport behind, the namespace they were in
# disappears from under them, and they keep running as orphans for as long as
# the machine is up. A day of running this left 324 of them holding six and a
# half gigabytes, which is also enough to make every measurement taken
# afterwards quietly wrong.
#
# Worse, they inherit this script's stdout. A caller that waits for the pipe to
# close — which is what a shell, a CI step and a task runner all do — waits for
# the orphans rather than for the test, so a run that finished in forty seconds
# looks like it is still going hours later.
#
# The trap covers every exit including the interrupt, because the interrupt is
# the case that leaks most: somebody stops a matrix half way through.
